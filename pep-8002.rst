Abstract
========

This PEP surveys existing and similar open source and free software projects
for their governance models, providing summaries that will serve as useful
references for Python's own selection of a new governance model in the wake of
`Guido's retirement
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005664.html>`_.

Rather than an individual PEP for each of these community surveys, they will
all be collected here in this PEP.
