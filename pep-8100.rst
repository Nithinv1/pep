PEP 13. This is the first steering council election.


Returns officer
===============

In future elections, the returns officer will be appointed by the
outgoing steering council. Since this is the first election, we have
no outgoing steering council, and PEP 13 says that the returns officer
is instead appointed by the PSF Executive Director, Ewa Jodlowska.
