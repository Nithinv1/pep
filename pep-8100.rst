Abstract
========

This document describes the schedule and other details of the January
2019 election for the Python steering council, as specified in
PEP 13. This is the first steering council election.


Returns officer
===============

In future elections, the returns officer will be appointed by the
outgoing steering council. Since this is the first election, we have
no outgoing steering council, and PEP 13 says that the returns officer
is instead appointed by the PSF Executive Director, Ewa Jodlowska.
`She appointed Ernest W. Durbin III
