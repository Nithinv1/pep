Abstract
========

This PEP provides an overview of the selection process for a new model of
Python language governance in the wake of `Guido's retirement
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005664.html>`_.
Once the governance model is selected, it will be codified in PEP 13.

Here is a list of PEPs related to the governance model selection process.
PEPs in the lower 8000s describe the general process for selecting a
governance model.

* PEP 8001 - Python Governance Voting Process

  This PEP describes how the vote for the new governance model will be
  conducted.  It outlines the voting method, timeline, criteria for
  participation, and explicit list of eligible voters.

* PEP 8002 - Open Source Governance Survey

  Surveys will be conducted of governance models for similar open source and
  free software projects, and summaries of these models will be outlined in
  this PEP.  These surveys will serve as useful barometers for how such
  projects can be successfully governed, and may serve as inspiration for
  Python's own governance model.  Python is unique, so it's expected that it
  will have its own spin on governance, rather than directly adopting any of
  those surveyed.

PEPs in the 8010s describe the actual proposals for Python governance.  It is
expected that these PEPs will cover the broad scope of governance, and that
differences in details (such as the size of a governing council) will be
covered in the same PEP, rather than in potentially vote-splitting individual
PEPs.

* PEP 8010 - The BDFL Governance Model

  This is a placeholder PEP for the continuation of the `Benevolent Dictator
  For Life <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life>`_
  model.  The name is an homage to Guido's title and does not necessarily
  imply that the next BDFL will be required to serve without time limit.  Also
  within scope is whether an advisory council aids or supports the BDFL.  This
  PEP does *not* name either the next BDFL, nor members of such an advisory
  council.  For that, see PEP 13.

* PEP 8011 - The Council Governance Model

  This is a placeholder PEP for a new model of Python governance based on a
  small Council of Pythonistas (COP).  It describes the size and role of the
  council, but it differs from PEP 8010 in that it does not propose a leader
  to whom the council answers.  The governing council makes the final
  decisions for the Python language.  This PEP does *not* name members of the
  council.  For that, see PEP 13.

* PEP 8012 - The Community Governance Model

  This is a placeholder PEP for a new model of Python governance based on
  consensus and voting, without the role of a centralized singular leader or a
  governing council.  It describes how, when, and why votes are conducted for
  decisions affecting the Python language.  It also describes the criteria for
  voting eligibility.

Additional governance models may be added before the final selection.
