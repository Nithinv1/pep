Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a new model of Python governance based on a Council of
Pythonistas (COP) tasked with making final decisions for the language.  It
differs from PEP 8010 by specifically not proposing a central singular leader.
It describes the size and role of the council, how the initial group of
council members will be chosen, any term limits of the council members, and
how successors will be elected.

This PEP does *not* name the council members.  Should this model be adopted,
it will be codified in PEP 13 along with the names of all officeholders
described in this PEP.
