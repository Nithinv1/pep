Abstract
========

This PEP describes a way to record the provenance of installed Python distributions.
The record is created by an installer and is available to users in
the form of a JSON file ``provenance_url.json`` in the ``.dist-info`` directory.
The mentioned JSON file captures additional metadata to allow recording a URL to a
:term:`distribution package` together with the installed distribution hash. This
proposal is built on top of :pep:`610` following
:ref:`its corresponding canonical PyPA spec <packaging:direct-url>` and
complements ``direct_url.json`` with ``provenance_url.json`` for when packages
are identified by a name, and optionally a version.

Motivation
==========

Installing a Python :term:`Project` involves downloading a :term:`Distribution Package`
from a :term:`Package Index`
and extracting its content to an appropriate place. After the installation
process is done, information about the release artifact used as well as its source
is generally lost. However, there are use cases for keeping records of
distributions used for installing packages and their provenance.

Python wheels can be built with different compiler flags or supporting
different wheel tags.  In both cases, users might get into a situation in which
multiple wheels might be considered by installers (possibly from different
package indexes) and immediately finding out which wheel file was actually used
during the installation might be helpful. This way, developers can use
information about wheels to debug issues making sure the desired wheel was
actually installed. Another use case could be tools reporting software
installed, such as tools reporting a SBOM (Software Bill of Materials), that might
give more accurate reports. Yet another use case could be reconstruction of the
Python environment by pinning each installed package to a specific distribution
artifact consumed from a Python package index.

Rationale
=========

The motivation described in this PEP is an extension of those in :pep:`610`.
Besides stating information about packages installed using a direct URL,
installers should record information also for packages installed from Python
package indexes when identified by their name, and optionally their version.

The idea described in this PEP originated in a tool called `micropipenv
<https://github.com/thoth-station/micropipenv>`__ that is used to install
:term:`distribution packages <Distribution Package>` in containerized
environments (see the reported issue `thoth-station/micropipenv#206`_). When
installing a :term:`Distribution Package` during a containerized application
build, the assembled containerized application does not implicitly carry
information about the provenance of installed :term:`distribution packages
<Distribution Package>` when installed using their name, and optionally their
version.  This creates a requirement for container image suppliers to link
container images with the corresponding build process, its configuration and
the application source code for checking requirements files in cases when
software present in containerized environments needs to be audited.

The `subsequent discussion in the Discourse thread
<https://discuss.python.org/t/pip-installation-reports/12316>`__ mentioned also
a new option ``--report`` in pip that can generate a detailed JSON report about
the installation process. This option could help with the provenance problem
this PEP approaches. Nevertheless, this option needs to be *explicitly* passed
to pip to have the provenance information and carries additional metadata that
might not be necessary for checking the provenance (such as Python version
requirements of each :term:`Distribution Package`). Also, this option is
specific to pip as of today.

Note the current :ref:`spec for recording installed packages
<packaging:recording-installed-packages>` defines a ``RECORD`` file that
records installed files, but not the installed artifact that brought these
files into the Python environment. Auditing installed artifacts could happen
based on matching the entries stated in the ``RECORD`` file. However, this
technique requires a pre-computed database of files each artifact provides or a
comparison with the actual artifact content. Both approaches are relatively
expensive and time consuming operations which could be eliminated with the
proposed ``provenance_url.json`` file.

Having information about the provenance of :term:`distribution packages
<Distribution Package>` stored in metadata files for cases when distribution
packages are installed by their direct URL as well as when installed by their
name and optionally their version from an index, can simplify auditing Python
environments in general. This auditing can be done beyond the use case for
containerized applications mentioned earlier and generalized for Python
environments. A community project `pip-audit
<https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit>`__ raised their possible interest in
`pypa/pip-audit#170`_.

Specification
=============

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHOULD”,
“SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL”
in this document are to be interpreted as described in :rfc:`2119`.

The ``provenance_url.json`` file SHOULD be created in the ``.dist-info``
directory by installers when installing a :term:`Distribution Package`
specified by name (and optionally by :term:`Version Specifier`).

This file MUST NOT be created when installing a distribution package from a requirement
specifying a direct URL reference (including a VCS URL).

Only one of the files ``provenance_url.json`` and ``direct_url.json`` (from :pep:`610`),
may be present in a given ``.dist-info`` directory; installers MUST NOT add both.

The ``provenance_url.json`` JSON file MUST be a dictionary, compliant with
:rfc:`8259` and UTF-8 encoded.

If present, it MUST contain exactly two keys. The first one is ``url``, with
type ``string``.  The second key MUST be ``archive_info`` with a value defined
below.

The value of the ``url`` key MUST be the URL from which the distribution package was downloaded. If a wheel is
built from a source distribution, the ``url`` value MUST be the URL from which
the source distribution was downloaded. If a wheel is downloaded and installed directly,
the ``url`` field MUST be the URL from which the wheel was downloaded.
As in the :ref:`direct URL origin specification<packaging:direct-url>`, the ``url`` value
MUST be stripped of any sensitive authentication information for security reasons.

The user:password section of the URL MAY however be composed of environment
variables, matching the following regular expression:

.. code-block:: text

    \$\{[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\}(:\$\{[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\})?

Additionally, the user:password section of the URL MAY be a well-known,
non-security sensitive string. A typical example is ``git`` in the case of an
URL such as ``ssh://git@gitlab.com``.

The value of ``archive_info`` MUST be a dictionary with a single key
``hashes``.  The value of ``hashes`` is a dictionary mapping hash function names to a
hex-encoded digest of the file referenced by the ``url`` value. Multiple hashes
can be included, and it is up to the consumer to decide what to do with
multiple hashes (it may validate all of them or a subset of them, or nothing at
all).

Each hash MUST be one of the single argument hashes provided by
:data:`py3.11:hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed`, excluding ``sha1`` and ``md5`` which MUST NOT be used.
As of Python 3.11, with ``shake_128`` and ``shake_256`` excluded
for being multi-argument, the allowed set of hashes is:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import hashlib
  >>> sorted(hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed - {"shake_128", "shake_256", "sha1", "md5"})
  ['blake2b', 'blake2s', 'sha224', 'sha256', 'sha384', 'sha3_224', 'sha3_256', 'sha3_384', 'sha3_512', 'sha512']

Each hash MUST be referenced by the canonical name of the hash, always lower case.

Hashes ``sha1`` and ``md5`` MUST NOT be present, due to the security
limitations of these hash algorithms. Conversely, hash ``sha256`` SHOULD
be included.

Installers that cache distribution packages from an index SHOULD keep
information related to the cached distribution artifact, so that
the ``provenance_url.json`` file can be created even when installing distribution packages
from the installer's cache.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Since this PEP specifies a new file in the ``.dist-info`` directory, there are
no backwards compatibility implications to consider in the ``provenance_url.json``
file itself. Also, this proposal does not make any changes to the
``direct_url.json`` described in :pep:`610` and
:ref:`its corresponding canonical PyPA spec <direct-url>`.

The content of ``provenance_url.json`` file was designed in a way to eventually
allow installers reuse some of the logic supporting ``direct_url.json`` when a
direct URL refers to a source archive or a wheel.

Security Implications
=====================

One of the main security features of the ``provenance_url.json`` file is the
ability to audit installed artifacts in Python environments. Tools can check
which Python package indexes were used to install Python :term:`distribution
packages <Distribution Package>` as well as the hash digests of their release
artifacts.

As an example, we can take the recent compromised dependency chain in `the
PyTorch incident <https://pytorch.org/blog/compromised-nightly-dependency/>`__.
The PyTorch index provided a package named ``torchtriton``. An attacker
published ``torchtriton`` on PyPI, which ran a malicious binary. By checking
the URL of the installed Python distribution stated in the
``provenance_url.json`` file, tools can automatically check the source of the
installed Python distribution. In case of the PyTorch incident, the URL of
``torchtriton`` should point to the PyTorch index, not PyPI. Tools can help
identifying such malicious Python distributions installed by checking the
installed Python distribution URL. A more exact check can include also the hash
of the installed Python distribution stated in the ``provenance_url.json``
file. Such checks on hashes can be helpful for mirrored Python package indexes
where Python distributions are not distinguishable by their source URLs, making
sure only desired Python package distributions are installed.

A malicious actor can intentionally adjust the content of
``provenance_url.json`` to possibly hide provenance information of the
installed Python distribution. A security check which would uncover such
malicious activity is beyond scope of this PEP as it would require monitoring
actions on the filesystem and eventually reviewing user or file permissions.

How to Teach This
=================

The ``provenance_url.json`` metadata file is intended for tools and is not
directly visible to end users.

Examples
========

Examples of a valid provenance_url.json
---------------------------------------

A valid ``provenance_url.json`` list multiple hashes:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "archive_info": {
      "hashes": {
        "blake2s": "fffeaf3d0bd71dc960ca2113af890a2f2198f2466f8cd58ce4b77c1fc54601ff",
        "sha256": "236bcb61156d76c4b8a05821b988c7b8c35bf0da28a4b614e8d6ab5212c25c6f",
        "sha3_256": "c856930e0f707266d30e5b48c667a843d45e79bb30473c464e92dfa158285eab",
        "sha512": "6bad5536c30a0b2d5905318a1592948929fbac9baf3bcf2e7faeaf90f445f82bc2b656d0a89070d8a6a9395761f4793c83187bd640c64b2656a112b5be41f73d"
      }
    },
    "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/07/51/2c0959c5adf988c44d9e1e0d940f5b074516ecc87e96b1af25f59de9ba38/pip-23.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"
  }

A valid ``provenance_url.json`` listing a single hash entry:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "archive_info": {
      "hashes": {
        "sha256": "236bcb61156d76c4b8a05821b988c7b8c35bf0da28a4b614e8d6ab5212c25c6f"
      }
    },
    "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/07/51/2c0959c5adf988c44d9e1e0d940f5b074516ecc87e96b1af25f59de9ba38/pip-23.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"
  }

A valid ``provenance_url.json`` listing a source distribution which was used to
build and install a wheel:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "archive_info": {
      "hashes": {
        "sha256": "8bfe29f17c10e2f2e619de8033a07a224058d96b3bfe2ed61777596f7ffd7fa9"
      }
    },
    "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/1d/43/ad8ae671de795ec2eafd86515ef9842ab68455009d864c058d0c3dcf680d/micropipenv-0.0.1.tar.gz"
  }

Examples of an invalid provenance_url.json
------------------------------------------

The following example includes a ``hash`` key in the ``archive_info`` dictionary
as originally designed in :pep:`610` and the data structure documented in
:ref:`packaging:direct-url`.
The ``hash`` key MUST NOT be present to prevent from any possible confusion
with ``hashes`` and additional checks that would be required to keep hash
values in sync.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "archive_info": {
      "hash": "sha256=236bcb61156d76c4b8a05821b988c7b8c35bf0da28a4b614e8d6ab5212c25c6f",
      "hashes": {
        "sha256": "236bcb61156d76c4b8a05821b988c7b8c35bf0da28a4b614e8d6ab5212c25c6f"
      }
    },
    "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/07/51/2c0959c5adf988c44d9e1e0d940f5b074516ecc87e96b1af25f59de9ba38/pip-23.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"
  }

Another example demonstrates an invalid hash name. The referenced hash name does not
correspond to the canonical hash names described in this PEP and
in the Python docs under :attr:`py3.11:hashlib.hash.name`.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "archive_info": {
      "hashes": {
        "SHA-256": "236bcb61156d76c4b8a05821b988c7b8c35bf0da28a4b614e8d6ab5212c25c6f"
      }
    },
    "url": "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/07/51/2c0959c5adf988c44d9e1e0d940f5b074516ecc87e96b1af25f59de9ba38/pip-23.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"
  }


Example pip commands and their effect on provenance_url.json and direct_url.json
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These commands generate a ``direct_url.json`` file but do not generate a
``provenance_url.json`` file. These examples follow examples from :pep:`610`:

* ``pip install https://example.com/app-1.0.tgz``
* ``pip install https://example.com/app-1.0.whl``
* ``pip install "git+https://example.com/repo/app.git#egg=app&subdirectory=setup"``
* ``pip install ./app``
* ``pip install file:///home/user/app``
* ``pip install --editable "git+https://example.com/repo/app.git#egg=app&subdirectory=setup"`` (in which case, ``url`` will be the local directory where the git repository has been cloned to, and ``dir_info`` will be present with ``"editable": true`` and no ``vcs_info`` will be set)
* ``pip install -e ./app``

Commands that generate a ``provenance_url.json`` file but do not generate
a ``direct_url.json`` file:

* ``pip install app``
* ``pip install app~=2.2.0``
* ``pip install app --no-index --find-links "https://example.com/"``

This behaviour can be tested using changes to pip implemented in the PR
`pypa/pip#11865`_.

Reference Implementation
========================

A proof-of-concept for creating the ``provenance_url.json`` metadata file when
installing a Python :term:`Distribution Package` is available in the PR to pip
`pypa/pip#11865`_. It reuses the already available implementation for the
:ref:`direct URL data structure <packaging:direct-url-data-structure>` to provide
the ``provenance_url.json`` metadata file for cases when ``direct_url.json`` is not
created.

A prototype called `pip-preserve <pip_preserve_>`_ was developed to
demonstrate creation of ``requirements.txt`` files considering ``direct_url.json``
and ``provenance_url.json`` metadata files.  This tool mimics the ``pip
freeze`` functionality, but the listing of installed packages also includes
the hashes of the Python distribution artifacts.

Rejected Ideas
==============

Naming the file direct_url.json instead of provenance_url.json
--------------------------------------------------------------

To preserve backwards compatibility with the
:ref:`Direct URL Origin specification <packaging:direct-url>`,
the file cannot be named ``direct_url.json``, as per the text of that specification:

  This file MUST NOT be created when installing a distribution from an other
  type of requirement (i.e. name plus version specifier).

Such a change might introduce backwards compatibility issues for consumers of
``direct_url.json`` who rely on its presence only when distributions are
installed using a direct URL reference.

Deprecating direct_url.json and using only provenance_url.json
--------------------------------------------------------------

File ``direct_url.json`` is already well established with :pep:`610` being accepted and is
already used by installers. For example, ``pip`` uses ``direct_url.json`` to
report a direct URL reference on ``pip freeze``. Deprecating
``direct_url.json`` would require additional changes to the ``pip freeze``
implementation in pip (see PR `fridex/pip#2`_) and could introduce backwards compatibility
issues for already existing ``direct_url.json`` consumers.

Keeping the hash key in the archive_info dictionary
---------------------------------------------------

:pep:`610` and :ref:`its corresponding canonical PyPA spec <direct-url>` discuss
the possibility to include the ``hash`` key alongside the ``hashes`` key in the
``archive_info`` dictionary. This PEP explicitly does not include the ``hash`` key in
the ``provenance_url.json`` file and allows only the ``hashes`` key to be present.
By doing so we eliminate possible redundancy in the file, possible confusion,
and any additional checks that would need to be done to make sure the hashes are in
sync.

Making the hashes key optional
------------------------------

:pep:`610` and :ref:`its corresponding canonical PyPA spec <direct-url>`
recommend including the ``hashes`` key of the ``archive_info`` in the
``direct_url.json`` file but it is not required (per the :rfc:`21119` language):

  A hashes key SHOULD be present as a dictionary mapping a hash name to a hex
  encoded digest of the file.

This PEP requires the ``hashes`` key be included in ``archive_info``
in the ``provenance_url.json`` file if that file is created; per this PEP:

  The value of ``archive_info`` MUST be a dictionary with a single key
  ``hashes``.

By doing so, consumers of ``provenance_url.json`` can check
artifact digests when the ``provenance_url.json`` file is created by installers.

Open Issues
===========

Availability of the provenance_url.json file in Conda
-----------------------------------------------------

We would like to get feedback on the ``provenance_url.json`` file from Conda
maintainers. It is not clear whether Conda would like to adopt
the ``provenance_url.json`` file.

Using provenance_url.json in downstream installers
--------------------------------------------------

The proposed ``provenance_url.json`` file was meant to be adopted primarily by
Python installers. Other installers, such as APT or DNF, might record the
provenance of the installed downstream Python distributions in their own
way specific to downstream package management. The proposed file is
not expected to be created by these downstream package installers and thus they
were intentionally left out of this PEP. However, any input by developers or
maintainers of these installers is valuable to possibly enrich the
``provenance_url.json`` file with information that would help in some way.
