Abstract
========

This PEP outlines the process for how the new model of Python governance is
selected, in the wake of `Guido's retirement
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005664.html>`_.
Once the model is chosen by the procedures outlined here, it will be codified
in PEP 13.
