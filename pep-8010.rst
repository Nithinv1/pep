Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a continuation of the `Benevolent Dictator For Life
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life>`_ (BDFL) model of
Python governance.  While currently a placeholder, it will describe such
processes as how the Guido+1 BDFL will be selected, how future successors will
be chosen, the role of the BDFL, and the role and size of any advisory
council.

This PEP does *not* name a new BDFL.  Should this model be adopted, it will be
codified in PEP 13 along with the names of all officeholders described in this
PEP.
