Issue tracker is **ONLY** used for reporting bugs.

New features should be discussed according to the following process:
[PEP 1](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/#start-with-an-idea-for-python)

And according to [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.rst):

While fixing spelling mistakes as part of more substantive
copyediting and proofreading of draft and active PEPs is okay,
we generally advise against PRs that simply mass-correct minor typos on
older PEPs that don't significantly impair meaning and understanding,
as these tend to create a fairly high level of noise and churn for
PEP readers, authors and editors relative to the amount of practical value
they provide.
