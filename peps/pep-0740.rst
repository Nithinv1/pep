Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a collection of changes related to the upload and distribution
of digitally signed attestations and metadata used to verify them on a Python
package repository, such as PyPI.

These changes have two subcomponents:

* Changes to the currently unstandardized PyPI upload API, allowing clients
  to upload digital attestations;
* Changes to the :pep:`503` and :pep:`691` "simple" APIs, allowing clients
  to retrieve both digital attestations and
  `Trusted Publishing <https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/>`_ metadata
  for individual release files.

This PEP does not recommend a specific digital attestation format, nor does
it make a policy recommendation around mandatory digital attestations on
release uploads or their subsequent verification by installing clients like
``pip``.

Rationale
=========

Desire for digital signatures on Python packages has been repeatedly
expressed by both package maintainers and downstream users:

* Maintainers wish to demonstrate the integrity and authenticity of their
  package uploads;
* Individual downstream users wish to verify package integrity and authenticity
  without placing additional trust in their index's honesty;
* "Bulk" downstream users (such as Operating System distributions) wish to
  perform similar verifications and potentially re-expose or countersign
  for their own downstream packaging ecosystems.

This proposal seeks to accommodate each of the above use cases.

While this PEP does not recommend a specific digital attestation format,
it does recognize the utility of Trusted Publishing as a pre-existing,
"zero-configuration" source of strong provenance for Python packages.
Consequently this PEP includes a proposed scheme for exposing each release
file's Trusted Publisher metadata, with the expectation that a future digital
attestation format will likely make use of it.

Design Considerations
---------------------

This PEP identifies the following design considerations when evaluating
both its own proposed changes and previous work in the same or adjacent
areas of Python packaging:

1. Index accessibility: digital attestations for Python packages
   are ideally retrievable directly from the index itself, as "detached"
   resources.

   This both simplifies some compatibility concerns (by avoiding
   the need to modify the distribution formats themselves) and also simplifies
   the behavior of potential installing clients (by allowing them to
   retrieve each attestation before its corresponding package without needing
   to do streaming decompression).

2. Verification by the index itself: in addition to enabling verification
   by installing clients, each digital attestation is *ideally* verifiable
   in some form by the index itself.

   This both increases the overall quality
   of attestations uploaded to the index (preventing, for example, users
   from accidentally uploading incorrect or invalid attestations) and also
   enables UI and UX refinements on the index itself (such as a "provenance"
   view for each uploaded package).

3. General applicability: digital attestations should be applicable to
   *any and every* package uploaded to the index, regardless of its format
   (sdist or wheel) or interior contents.

4. Metadata support: this PEP refers to "digital attestations" rather than
   just "digital signatures" to emphasize the ideal presence of additional
   metadata within the cryptographic envelope.

   For example, to prevent domain separation between a distribution's name and
   its contents, the digital attestation could be performed over
   ``HASH(name || HASH(contents))`` rather than just ``HASH(contents)``.

5. Consistent release attestations: if a file belonging to a release has a
   set of digital attestations, then all of the other files belonging to that
   release should also have the same types of attestations.

   This simplifies the downstream use story for digital attestations, and
   prevents potentially vulnerable "swiss cheese" release patterns (where
   a verifier checks for a valid attestation on ``HolyGrail-1.0.tar.gz``
   but their installing client actually resolves an attacker-controlled,
   platform-specific ``.whl`` instead).


Previous Work
-------------

PGP signatures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PyPI and other indices have historically supported PGP signatures on uploaded
distributions. These could be supplied during upload, and could be retrieved
by installing clients via the ``data-gpg-sig`` attribute in the :pep:`503`
API, the ``gpg-sig`` key on the :pep:`691` API, or via an adjacent
``.asc``-suffixed URL.

PGP signature uploads have been disabled on PyPI since
`May 2023 <https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-05-23-removing-pgp/>`_, after
`an investigation <https://blog.yossarian.net/2023/05/21/PGP-signatures-on-PyPI-worse-than-useless>`_
determined that the majority of signatures (which, themselves, constituted a
tiny percentage of overall uploads) could not be associated with a public key or
otherwise meaningfully verified.

In their previously supported form on PyPI, PGP signatures satisfied
considerations (1) and (3) above but not (2) (owing to the need for external
keyservers and key distribution) or (4) (due to PGP signatures typically being
constructed over just an input file, without any associated signed metadata).
Similarly, PyPI's historical implementation of PGP did not satisfy consideration
(5), due to a lack of consistency checks between different release files
(and an inability to perform those checks due to no access to the signer's
public key).

Wheel signatures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:pep:`427` (and its :ref:`living PyPA counterpart <packaging:binary-distribution-format>`)
specify the :term:`wheel format <packaging:Wheel>`.

This format includes accommodations for digital signatures embedded directly
into the wheel, in either JWS or S/MIME format. These signatures are specified
over a :pep:`376` RECORD, which is modified to include a cryptographic digest
for each recorded file in the wheel.

While wheel signatures are fully specified, they do not appear to be broadly
used; the official `wheel tooling <https://github.com/pypa/wheel>`_ deprecated
signature generation and verification support
`in 0.32.0 <https://wheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/news.html>`_, which was
released in 2018.

Additionally, wheel signatures do not satisfy any of
the above considerations (due to the "attached" nature of the signatures,
non-verifiability on the index itself, and support for wheels only).

Specification
=============

Upload endpoint changes
-----------------------

The current upload API is not standardized. However, we propose the following
changes to it:

* In addition to the current top-level ``content`` and ``gpg_signature`` fields,
  the index **SHALL** accept ``attestations`` as an additional multipart form
  field.
* The new ``attestations`` field **SHALL** be a JSON object.
* The JSON object **SHALL** have one or more keys, each identifying an
  attestation format known to the index. If any key does not identify an
  attestation format known to the index, the index **MUST** reject the upload.
* The value associated with each well-known key **SHALL** be a JSON object.
* Each attestation value **MUST** be verifiable by the index. If the index fails
  to verify any attestation in ``attestations``, it **MUST** reject the upload.

In addition to the above, the index **SHALL** enforce a consistency
policy for release attestations via the following:

* If the first file under a new release is supplied with ``attestations``,
  then all subsequently uploaded files under the same release **MUST** also
  have ``attestations``. Conversely, if the first file under a new release
  does not have any ``attestations``, then all subsequent uploads under the
  same release **MUST NOT** have ``attestations``.
* All files under the same release **MUST** have the same set of well-known
  attestation format keys.

The index **MUST** reject any file upload that does not satisfy these
consistency properties.

Index changes
-------------

Simple Index
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* When an uploaded file has an attestation, the index **MAY** include a
  ``data-attestations`` attribute on its file link, with a value of either
  ``true`` or ``false``.
* When ``data-attestations`` is ``true``, the index **MUST** serve the uploaded
  file's attestations at the same URL, but with ``.attestations`` appended to
  it. For example, if ``HolyGrail-1.0.tar.gz`` existed and had associated
  attestations, those attestations would be located at
  ``HolyGrail-1.0.tar.gz.attestations``.
* The attestations served by the index **SHALL** be in JSON format, with the
  same well-known keys as accepted by the upload endpoint.

.. TODO: Represent the trusted publisher metadata here, somehow.

JSON-based Simple API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* When an uploaded file has an attestation, the index **MAY** include an
  ``attestations`` key in the ``file`` dictionary for that file.
* The ``attestations`` key, when present, **MUST** be a JSON object with
  the same well-known keys and values as accepted by the upload endpoint.

In addition to the above, when an uploaded file was uploaded via
`Trusted Publishing <https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/>`_:

* The ``file`` dictionary **MAY** include a ``publisher`` key.
* The ``publisher`` key, when present, **MUST** be a JSON object with a
  representation of the file's Trusted Publisher configuration at the time
  of upload.
* The keys within the ``publisher`` object are specific to each
  Trusted Publisher but include, at minimum, a ``type`` key uniquely identifying
  the type of Trusted Publisher. For example, for a GitHub-based Trusted
  Publisher, the ``type`` may be the string ``"GitHub"``.

Security Implications
=====================

This PEP is "mechanical" in nature; it provides only the plumbing for future
digital attestations on package indices, without specifying their concrete
cryptographic details.

As such, we do not identify any positive or negative security implications
for this PEP.

Appendix 1: Example Uploaded Attestations
=========================================

This appendix provides a fictional example of the ``attestations`` field
submitted on file upload, with two fictional attestations (``publish`` and
``timestamp``):

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "publish": {
            "mediaType": "application/vnd.dev.sigstore.bundle+json;version=0.2",
            "verificationMaterial": { /* omitted for brevity */ },
            "messageSignature": {
                "messageDigest": {
                    "algorithm": "some-hash-algo",
                    "digest": "digest-here"
                },
                "signature": "signature-here"
            }
        },
        "timestamp": {
            "cms": "some-long-blob-here"
        }
    }

The payloads of these fictional attestations are purely illustrative.

Appendix 2: Example Trusted Publisher Representation
====================================================

This appendix provides a fictional example of a ``publisher`` key within
a :pep:`691` ``project.files[]`` listing:

.. code-block:: json

    "publisher": {
        "type": "GitHub",
        "repository_name": "HolyGrail",
        "repository_owner": "octocat",
        "repository_owner_id": "1",
        "workflow_filename": "publish.yml",
        "environment": null
    }
