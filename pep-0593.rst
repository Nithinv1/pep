Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a list of improvements to make bugs.python.org more
usable for contributors and core developers.

It also correct factual errors about Roundup's capabilities in PEP 581.


Roadmap
=======

Features
--------

* **Mobile friendly theme:** Current theme of bugs.python.org looks
  dated and it doesn't work well with mobile browsers. We want to
  replace it with a more modern and mobile-friendly theme by keeping
  its main look same.

* **Support logging in with GitHub:** We are getting reports from new
  contributors about missing confirmation emails. Using GitHub for
  logging in to bugs.python.org would make the contributing process
  much easier.

* **Support Markdown in comments:**

* **Add PR link to bPO emails:** The patch at https://mail.python.org/pipermail/tracker-discuss/2018-June/004547.html
  changes the BPO mail from::

     components: +Tkinter
     versions: +Python 3.4
     pull_requests: +42

  to::

     components: +Tkinter
     versions: +Python 3.4
     pull_request: https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/341


Bugs
----

.. Hidden email bug
.. Listing user emails https://bugs.python.org/issue32177


Infrastructure
--------------

* Our Roundup fork can easily be ditched. The biggest dependency is our
  REST API. See the GSoC project section for more details.

* Once we get rid of our Roundup fork, we can easily move source code for
  bugs.python.org instance to GitHub to attract more contributors.

* We already have a Docker image to install development environment at
  https://github.com/python/docker-bpo
