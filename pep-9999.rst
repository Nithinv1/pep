Abstract
========

This PEP specifies an improved syntax for specifying type parameters within
a generic class, function or type alias.


Motivation
==========

:pep:`484` introduced type variables into the language. :pep:`612` built
upon this concept by introducing parameter specifications, and
:pep:`646` added variadic type variables.

Points of Confusion
-------------------

While the use of type variables has become widespread, the manner in which
they are specified within code is the source of significant confusion among
Python developers. There are a couple of factors that contribute to this
confusion.

The scoping rules for type variables are difficult to understand. Type
variables are typically allocated within the global scope, but their semantic
meaning is valid only when used within the context of a generic class,
function or or type alias. A single runtime instance of a type variable may be
reused in multiple generic contexts, and it has a different semantic meaning
in each of these contexts. This PEP proposes to eliminate this source of
confusion by declaring type parameters at a natural place within a class,
function or type alias declaration statement.

Generic type aliases are often misused because it is not clear to developers
that a type argument must be supplied when the type alias is used. This leads
to an implied type argument of ``Any``, which is rarely the intent. This PEP
proposes to add new syntax that makes generic type alias declarations
clear.

:pep:`483` and :pep:`484` introduced the concept of "variance" for a type
variable used within a generic class. Type variables can be invariant,
covariant, or contravariant. The concept of variance is an advanced detail
of type theory that is not well understood by most Python developers, yet
they are immediately confronted with the concept today when defining their
first generic class. This PEP largely eliminates the need for most developers
to understand the concept of variance when defining generic classes.

When more than one type parameter is used with a generic class or type alias,
the rules for type parameter ordering can be confusing. It is normally based on
the order in which they first appear within a class or type alias declaration
statement. However, this can be overridden in a class definition by
including a "Generic" or "Protocol" base class. For example, in the class
declaration ``class ClassA(Mapping[K, V])``, the type parameters are
ordered as ``K`` and then ``V``. However, in the class declaration
``class ClassB(Mapping[K, V], Generic[V, K])``, the type parameters are
ordered as ``V`` and then ``K``. This PEP proposes to make type parameter
ordering explicit in all cases.

The practice of sharing a type variable across multiple generic contexts
creates other problems today. Modern editors provide features like "find
all references" and "rename all references" that operate on symbols at the
semantic level. When a type parameter is shared among multiple generic
classes, functions, and type aliases, all references are semantically
equivalent.

Type variables defined within the global scope also need to be given a name
that starts with an underscore to indicate that the variable is private to
the module. Globally-defined type variables are also often given names to
indicate their variance leading to cumbersome names like "_T_contra" and
"_KT_co". The current mechanisms for allocating type variables also requires
the developer to supply a redundant name in quotes (e.g. ``T = TypeVar("T")``).
This PEP eliminates the need for the redundant name and the cumbersome
variable names.

Defining type parameters today requires importing the ``TypeVar`` and 
``Generic`` symbols from the ``typing`` module. Over the past several releases
of Python, efforts have been made to eliminate the need to import ``typing``
symbols for common use cases, and the PEP furthers this goal.


Summary Examples
================

Defining a generic class prior to this PEP looks something like this.

::

    from typing import Generic, TypeVar

    _T_co = TypeVar("_T_co", covariant=True, bound=str)

    class ClassA(Generic[_T_co]):
        ...


With the new syntax, it looks like this.

::

    class ClassA[T: str]:
        ...


Here is an example of a generic function today.

::

    from typing import ParamSpec, TypeVar, Callable

    _P = ParamSpec("_P")
    _R = TypeVar("_R")

    def func(cb: Callable[_P, _R], *args: _P.args, **kwargs: _P.kwargs) -> _R:
        ...

And the new syntax.

::

    from typing import Callable

    def func[**P, R](cb: Callable[P, R], *args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs) -> R:
        ...


Here is an example of a generic type alias today.

::

    from typing import TypeAlias

    _T = TypeVar("_T")

    ListOrSet: TypeAlias = list[_T] | set[_T]


And with the new syntax.

::

    type ListOrSet[T] = list[T] | set[T]


Specification
=============

Type Parameter Declarations
---------------------------

We propose to add new syntax for declaring type parameters for generic
classes, functions, and type aliases. The syntax adds support for
a comma-delimited list of type parameters in square brackets after
the name of the class, function, or type alias.

Simple (non-variadic) type variables are declared with an unadorned name.
Variadic type variables are preceded by ``*``. Parameter specifications are
preceded by ``**``.

::

    # This generic class is parameterized by a TypeVar T, a
    # TypeVarTuple Ts, and a ParamSpec P.
    class ChildClass[T, *Ts, **P]: ...

There is no need to include ``Generic`` as a base class. Its inclusion as
a base class is implied by the presence of type parameters. The explicit
use of a ``Generic`` base class will result in a runtime error.

::

    class ClassA[T](Generic[T]): ...  # Runtime error


A ``Protocol`` base class with type arguments will not generate a runtime
error, but type checkers should generate an error in this case because
the use of type arguments is not needed, and the order of type parameters
for the class are no longer dictated by their order in the ``Protocol``
base class.

::

    class ClassA[S, T](Protocol): ... # OK

    class ClassB[S, T](Protocol[S, T]): ... # Recommended type checker error


Type parameter names within a generic class, function, or type alias must
be unique. Type parameters for a generic function cannot overlap the name
of a function parameter. A duplicate name generates a syntax error at compile
time.

::

    class ClassA[T, *T]: ... # Syntax Error

    def func1[T, **T](): ... # Syntax Error

    def func2[T](T): ... # Syntax Error


Type Parameter Scopes
---------------------

A type parameter declared as part of a generic class is valid only within the
class body. Type parameters are also accessible when evaluating the argument list
(base classes and any keyword arguments) that comprise the class definition.
This allows base classes to be parameterized by these type parameters. Type
parameters are not accessible outside of the class body, including in any class
decorators.

::

    class ClassA[T](BaseClass[T], param = Foo[T]): ...  # OK

    print(T)  # Runtime error: 'T' is not defined

    @dec(Foo[T])  # Runtime error: 'T' is not defined
    class ClassA[T]: ...

A type parameter declared as part of a generic function is valid only within
the function body and within parameter and return type annotations. Default
argument values are evaluated outside of this scope, so type parameters are
not accessible in default value expressions. Likewise, type parameters are not
in scope for function decorators.

::

    def func1[T](a: T) -> T: ...  # OK

    print(T)  # Runtime error: 'T' is not defined

    def func2[T](a = list[T]): ...  # Runtime error: 'T' is not defined

    @dec(list[T])  # Runtime error: 'T' is not defined
    def func3[T](): ...


Upper Bound Specification
-------------------------

For a non-variadic type parameter, an "upper bound" type can be specified
through the use of a type annotation expression. If an upper bound is
not specified, the upper bound is assumed to be ``object``.

::

    class ClassA[T: str]: ...

The specified upper bound type must use an expression form that is allowed in
type annotations. More complex expression forms should be flagged
as an error by a type checker. Quoted forward declarations are allowed.

The specified upper bound type must be concrete. An attempt to use a generic
type should be flagged as an error by a type checker.

::

    class ClassA[T: dict[str, int]]: ...  # OK

    class ClassB[T: "ForwardDeclaration"]: ...  # OK

    class ClassC[T: dict[str, V]]: ...  # Type checker error: generic type

    class ClassD[T: [str, int]]: ...  # Type checker error: illegal expression form


Constrained Type Specification
------------------------------

For a non-variadic type parameter, a set of two or more "constrained types"
can be specified through the use of a literal tuple expression that contains
two or more types.

::

    class ClassA[AnyStr: (str, bytes)]: ...  # OK

    class ClassB[T: ("ForwardDeclaration", bytes)]: ...  # OK

    class ClassC[T: ()]: ...  # Type checker error: two or more types required

    class ClassD[T: (str, )]: ...  # Type checker error: two or more types required

    t1 = (bytes, str)
    class ClassE[T: t1]: ...  # Type checker error: literal tuple expression required


If the specified type is not a tuple expression or the tuple expression includes
complex expression forms that are not allowed in a type annotation, a type
checker should generate an error. Quoted forward declarations are allowed.

::

    class ClassE[T: (3, bytes)]: ...  # Type checker error: invalid expression form


The specified constrained types must be concrete. An attempt to use a generic
type should be flagged as an error by a type checker.

::

    class ClassG[T: (list[S], str)]: ...  # Type checker error: generic type



Generic Type Alias
------------------

We propose to introduce a new statement for declaring type aliases. Similar
to ``class`` and ``def`` statements, a ``type`` statement defines a scope
for type parameters. 

::

    # A non-generic type alias
    type IntOrStr = int | str

    # A generic type alias
    type ListOrSet[T] = list[T] | set[T]


Type aliases can refer to themselves without the use of quotes.

::

    # A type alias that refers to a forward-declared type
    type AnimalOrVegetable = "Animal" | "Vegetable"

    # A generic self-referential type alias
    type RecursiveList[T] = T | list[RecursiveList[T]]


The ``type`` keyword is a new soft keyword. It is interpreted as a keyword
only in this part of the grammar. In all other locations, it is assumed to
be an identifier name.

Type parameters declared as part of a generic type alias are valid only
when evaluating the right-hand side of the type alias.

As with ``typing.TypeAlias``, type checkers should restrict the right-hand
expression to expression forms that are allowed within type annotations.
The use of more complex expression forms (call expressions, trinary operators,
arithmetic operators, comparison operators, etc.) should be flagged as an
error.

Type alias expressions are not allowed to use traditional type variables.
Type checker should generate an error in this case.

::

    T = TypeVar("T")
    type MyList = list[T]  # Type checker error: traditional type variable usage


We propose to deprecate the existing ``typing.TypeAlias`` introduced in
:pep:`613`. The new syntax eliminates its need entirely.


Runtime Type Alias Class
------------------------

At runtime, a ``type`` statement will generate an instance of
``typing.TypeAliasType``. This class represents the type. Its attributes
include:
``__name__`` is a str representing the name of the type alias
``__parameters__`` is a tuple of TypeVar, TypeVarTuple or ParamSpec objects
``__value__`` is the evaluated value of the type alias


Variance Inference
------------------

We propose to eliminate the need for variance to be specified for type
parameters. Instead, type checkers will infer the variance of type parameters
based on their usage within a class. Type parameters can be invariant,
covariant, or contravariant depending on how they are used.

Python type checkers already include the ability to determine the variance of
type parameters for the purpose of validating variance within a generic
protocol class. This capability can be used for all classes (whether or not
they are protocols) to calculate the variance of each type parameter. This
eliminates the need for most developers to understand the concept of variance.
It also eliminates the need to introduce a dedicated syntax for specifying
variance.

The algorithm for computing the variance of a type parameter is as follows.

For each type parameter in a generic class:

1. If the type parameter is variadic (TypeVarTuple) or a parameter specification
(ParamSpec), it is always considered invariant. No further inference is needed.

2. If the type parameter comes from a traditional ``TypeVar`` declaration and
is not specified as ``autovariance`` (see below), its variance is specified
by the caller. No further inference is needed.

3. Create two specialized versions of the class. We'll refer to these as
``upper`` and ``lower`` specializations. In both of these specializations,
replace all type parameters other than the one being inferred by a dummy type
instance. In the ``upper`` specialized class, specialize the target type
parameter with an ``object`` instance. In the ``lower`` specialized class,
specialize the target type parameter with itself. This specialization
ignores the type parameter's upper bound or constraints.

4. Determine whether ``lower`` can be assigned to ``upper`` using normal type
compatibility rules. If so, the target type parameter is covariant. If not,
determine whether ``upper`` can be assigned to ``lower``. If so, the target
type parameter is contravariant. If neither of these combinations are
assignable, the target type parameter is invariant.

Here is an example.

::

    class ClassA[T1, T2, T3](list[T1]):
        def method1(self, a: T2) -> None:
            ...
        
        def method2(self) -> T3:
            ...

To determine the variance of ``T1``, we specialize ``ClassA`` as follows:

::

    upper = ClassA[object, Dummy, Dummy]
    lower = ClassA[T1, Dummy, Dummy]

We find that ``upper`` is not assignable to ``lower`` nor is ``lower``
assignable to ``upper`` using standard type compatibility checks, so we
can conclude that ``T1`` is invariant.

To determine the variance of ``T2``, we specialize ``ClassA`` as follows:

::

    upper = ClassA[Dummy, object, Dummy]
    lower = ClassA[Dummy, T2, Dummy]

Since ``upper`` is assignable to ``lower``, ``T2`` is covariant.

To determine the variance of ``T3``, we specialize ``ClassA`` as follows:

::

    upper = ClassA[Dummy, Dummy, object]
    lower = ClassA[Dummy, Dummy, T3]

Since ``lower`` is assignable to ``upper``, ``T3`` is contravariant.



Auto Variance For TypeVar
-------------------------

The existing ``TypeVar`` class constructor accepts keyword parameters named
``covariant`` and ``contravariant``. If both of these are ``False``, the
type variable is assumed to be invariant. We propose to add another keyword
parameter named ``autovariance``. A corresponding instance variable
``__autovariance__`` can be accessed at runtime to determine whether the
variance is inferred. Type variables that are implicitly allocated using the
new syntax will always have ``__autovariance__`` set to ``True``.

A generic class that uses the traditional syntax may include combinations of
type variables with explicit and inferred variance.

::

    T1 = TypeVar("T1", autovariance=True)  # Inferred variance
    T2 = TypeVar("T2")  # Invariant
    T3 = TypeVar("T3", covariant=True)  # Covariant

    # A type checker should infer the variance for T1 but use the
    # specified variance for T2 and T3.
    class ClassA(Generic[T1, T2, T3]): ...


Compatibility with Traditional TypeVars
---------------------------------------

The existing mechanism for allocating ``TypeVar``, ``TypeVarTuple``, and
``ParamSpec`` is retained for backward compatibility. However, these
"traditional" type variables should not be combined with type parameters
allocated using the new syntax. Such a combination should be flagged as
an error by type checkers. This is necessary because the type parameter
order is ambiguous.

It is OK to combine traditional type variables with new-style type parameters
if the class, function, or type alias does not use the new syntax. The
new-style type parameters must come from an outer scope in this case.

::

    K = TypeVar("K")

    class ClassA[V](dict[K, V]): ...  # Type checker error

    class ClassB[K, V](dict[K, V]): ...  # OK

    class ClassC[V]:
        # The use of K and V for "method1" is OK because it uses the
        # "traditional" generic function mechanism where type parameters
        # are implicit. In this case V comes from an outer scope (ClassC)
        # and K is introduced implicitly as a type parameter for "method1".
        def method1(self, a: V, b: K) -> V | K: ...

        # The use of M and K are not allowed for "method2". A type checker
        # should generate an error in this case because this method uses the
        # new syntax for type parameters, and all type parameters associated
        # with the method must be explicitly declared. In this case, ``K``
        # is not declared by "method2", nor is it supplied defined an outer
        # scope.
        def method2[M](self, a: M, b: K) -> M | K: ...


Runtime Implementation
======================

Grammar Changes
---------------

This PEP introduces a new soft keyword ``type``. It modifies the grammar
in the following ways:

1. Addition of optional type parameter clause in ``class`` and ``def`` statements.

::
    
    type_params: '[' t=type_param_seq  ']'

    type_param_seq: a[asdl_typeparam_seq*]=','.type_param+ [',']

    type_param:
        | a=NAME b=[type_param_bound]
        | '*' a=NAME
        | '**' a=NAME

    type_param_bound: ":" e=expression


2. Addition of new ``type`` statement for defining type aliases.

::

    type_alias[stmt_ty]:
        | "type" n=NAME t=[type_params] '=' b=expression {
            CHECK_VERSION(stmt_ty, 12, "Type statement is", _PyAST_TypeAlias(n->v.Name.id, t, b, EXTRA)) }


AST Changes
-----------

This PEP introduces a new AST node type called "TypeAlias".

::

    TypeAlias(identifier name, typeparam* typeparams, expr value)

It also adds an AST node that represents a type parameter.

::

    typeparam = TypeVar(identifier name, expr? bound)
        | ParamSpec(identifier name)
        | TypeVarTuple(identifier name)

It also modifies existing AST nodes ``FunctionDef``, ``AsyncFunctionDef`` and
``ClassDef`` to include an additional optional attribute called ``typeparam*``
that includes a list of type parameters associated with the function or class.


Compiler Changes
----------------

The compiler maintains a list of "active type parameters" as it recursively
generates byte codes for the program. Consider the following example.

::

    class Outer[K, V]:
        # Active type parameters are K and V

        class Inner[T]:
            # Active type parameters are K, V, and T

            def method[M](self, a: M) -> M:
                # Active type parameters are K, V, T, and M
                ...

An active type parameter symbol cannot be used for other purposes within
these scopes. This includes local parameters, local variables, variables
bound from other scopes (nonlocal or global), or other type parameters. An
attempt to reuse a type parameter name in one of these manners results in
a syntax error.

::

    class ClassA[K, V]:
        class Inner[K]: # Syntax error: K already in use as type parameter
            ...

    class ClassB[K, V]:
        def method(self, K): # Syntax error: K already in use as type parameter
            ...

    class ClassC[T, T]: # Syntax error: T already in use as type parameter
        ...

    def func1[T]():
        ...


A type parameter is considered "active" when compiling the arguments for
a class declaration, the type annotations for a function declaration, and
the right-hand expression in a type alias declaration. Type parameters are
not considered "active" when compiling the default argument expressions for
a function declaration or decorator expressions for classes or functions.

::

    T = list

    @decorator(T) # T in decorator refers to outer variable
    class ClassA[T](Base[T], metaclass=Meta[T]) # T refers to type parameter
        ...

    @decorator(T) # T in decorator refers to outer variable
    def func1[T](a: list[T]) -> T: # T refers to type parameter
        ...

    def func2[T](a = T): # T in default refers to outer variable
        ...


When a type parameter is referenced, the compiler generates a byte code to
construct a ``typing.TypeParameter`` object. This new class can be thought
of as a proxy for ``TypeVar``, ``TypeVarTuple`` or ``ParamSpec``. It has a
name and ``args`` and ``kwargs`` properties so it can be used within a
type expression at runtime. It does not allow for runtime differentiation
between a ``TypeVar``, ``TypeVarTuple`` or ``ParamSpec``, nor does it
allow for runtime introspection of the upper bound, constraints, or
variance.

If a bound expression is provided for a type parameter, it is validated for
syntax but is not evaluated at runtime. Type checkers should evaluate its
type statically.


Reference Implementation
========================

This proposal is prototyped in the cpython code base in
`this fork <https://github.com/erictraut/cpython/tree/type_param_syntax>`_.


The Pyright type checker supports the behavior described in this PEP.

A reference implementation for CPython can be found 
`here <https://erictraut/cpython/typeparam>`_.

TODO: Update the above URL once reference implementation is
pushed to github. It is current working as a proof of concept, but there
are aspects of the spec that remain unimplemented.
