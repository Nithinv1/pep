Abstract
========

This PEP recommends deprecating and then disabling new uploads of the
``bdist_egg`` distribution type on PyPI. In a parallel move, this PEP recommends
deprecating and then disabling new uploads of distribution filenames that have
the ``.egg`` suffix.

It does not recommend removing or otherwise affecting any previously
uploaded ``bdist_egg`` distributions or files with the ``.egg`` suffix.

Rationale
=========

Previous Work
-------------

The groundwork for this proposal was established with :pep:`527`, which
proposed deprecating and eventually removing upload support for a handful
of un(der)used file extensions and distribution types.

In particular, :pep:`527` proposed the removal of the ``bdist_dumb``,
``bdist_rpm``, ``bdist_dmg``, ``bdist_msi``, and ``bdist_wininst`` distribution
types, as well as the ``.tar``, ``.tar.bz2``, ``.tar.xz``, ``.tar.Z``,
``.tgz``, and ``.tbz`` file extensions on distribution filenames.

:pep:`527` was fully enacted with
`PR #7529 <https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/7529>`_ to Warehouse,
which was merged on 13 April 2020.

The ``bdist_egg`` format
------------------------

The ``bdist_egg`` filetype identifies distributions in the
:term:`egg format <packaging:Egg>`. The
egg format was introduced by setuptools in 2004 and is roughly equivalent
in functionality to the
:term:`wheel format <packaging:Wheel>`
first introduced by :pep:`427` in 2012 as the standardized
:ref:`built distribution format <packaging:binary-distribution-format>`.

Despite its longevity, the egg format has had
`limited adoption on PyPI <https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/10653>`_.
Some observations from that issue:

* In the month of May 2023, ``bdist_egg`` uploads accounted for 0.2% of all
  distribution uploads to PyPI;
* ``pip`` deprecated its ``--egg`` option in 2016;
* ``setuptools`` has considered egg support deprecated since 2019;
* ``build`` only supports the ``sdist`` and ``bdist_wheel`` filetypes.

Given the above, this PEP proposes the removal of the ``bdist_egg`` format
under the same justifications presented in :pep:`527`, namely:

* egg distributions are of of limited use to the broader ecosystem and
  therefore represent a non-reciprocal maintenance burden;
* Continued support for egg distributions represents a bandwidth and storage
  cost to PyPI, as well as to any external mirrors of PyPI.

This PEP *additionally* offers an argument for removal rooted in
standardization and duplication: the egg format is not standardized by any
PEP or other community standard, and overlaps heavily with its standardized
and well-supported alternative (wheel).

The ``.egg`` file extension
---------------------------

The ``.egg`` file extension is used exclusively for distributions of the
``bdist_egg`` format. As such, it serves no purpose in a scenario where
PyPI disables new distribution uploads for ``bdist_egg`` distributions.

Removal Process
===============

This PEP proposes using the same removal process specified in :pep:`527`.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Limited Impact
--------------

As noted in the rationale section, this PEP is expected to have no impact
on the overwhelming majority of PyPI users.

Hosted Files
------------

This PEP does **NOT** propose the removal of any egg distributions that have
already been uploaded to PyPI. All previously uploaded egg distributions will
remain downloadable, ensuring that existing users will continue to be able
to download them.

Deprecation Period
------------------

This PEP uses the removal process documented in :pep:`527`, which specifies
a deprecation period of 1 month for projects that have previously uploaded
egg distributions to PyPI.

After the end of the deprecation period, support for uploading new egg
distributions will cease to exist on PyPI.

Security Implications
=====================

This PEP does not identify any positive or negative security implications
associated with removing upload support for egg distributions.

How To Teach This
=================

As part of the :pep:`527` removal process, PyPI will send emails to all
maintainers of projects who have previously uploaded egg distributions.

Additionally, PyPI will write a post on the
`PyPI blog <https://blog.pypi.org/>`_ that publicly announces the deprecation
period's start and end.
