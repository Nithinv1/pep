Reduce-Map Comprehensions (and the "last" builtin)
=========

Abstract
--------

This PEP proposes the addition of new list-comprehension syntax, and one built-in function "last", which would allow us to replace the reduce operator with list-comprehension-style syntax, allows us to define a "Reduce-Map" comprehension, which performs a reduction but saves every intermediate element into a list.  

Rationale
--------

One current awkwardness of Python comes about when you want to perform a chain of operations and save all intermediate processing steps.  Let's use the example:

.. code-block:: python

    def exponential_moving_average(signal: Iterable[float], decay: float, initial_value: float=0.):
        running_average = []
        average = initial_value
        for xt in signal:
            average = (1-decay)*average + decay*xt
            running_average.append(average)
        return running_average
    
    signal = [math.sin(i*0.01) + random.normalvariate(0, 0.1) for i in range(1000)]
    smooth_signal = exponential_moving_average((math.sin(i*0.01,) for i in range(1000)), decay=0.05)


        
A more savvy Pythonista may rewrite this as a generator:

.. code-block:: python

    def exponential_moving_average(signal: Iterable[float], decay: float, initial_value: float=0.):
        average = initial_value
        for xt in signal:
            average = (1-decay)*average + decay*xt
            yield average
    
    signal = [math.sin(i*0.01) + random.normalvariate(0, 0.1) for i in range(1000)]
    smooth_signal = list(exponential_moving_average((math.sin(i*0.01,) for i in range(1000)), decay=0.05))
    
Still, this seems like an awful lot of lines to express such a simple thing.


Proposal
--------

**Reduce-Map Comprehensions**

We propose the syntax:

.. code-block:: python

    smooth_signal = [average = (1-decay)*average + decay*x for x in signal from average=0.]
    
- The :code:`from` keyword, normally reserved for imports, would be repurposed here to specify an initial value to a reduction. 
- If :code:`average` were not specified in the initial conditions, it could (1) be taken from the scope, or (2) raise a :code:`NameError`.

**The "last" builtin**

Because it may be a common case to only want the last element in this expression (as it is when you use reduce), we propose an additional :code:`last` builtin function to handle this nicely.  For example, if you just wanted the last element of the running sum, you could do: 

.. code-block:: python
    
    last_smooth_element = last(average = (1-decay)*average + decay*x for x in signal from average=0.)
    
When used on a ReduceMap generator, the :code:`last` builtin would

- Take the final value produced by the iterable (if the iterable yields any items) OR
- Take the initial value (defined in from) otherwise.

When used on a normal iterable (or a Reduce-Map generator without a :code:`from ...` initializer), :code:`last` would behave like:

.. code-block:: python

    def last_on_normal_generator(generator):
        """The proposed `last` builtin, as it would behave on a non-ReduceMap generator"""
        x = next(generator)
        for x in generator:
            pass
        return x

Like :code:`next`, this would throw a :code:`NameError` if given an empty generator.


Extension: Specifying the value to keep
--------

It may be the case that there are variables in the loop that you want to carry forward through the reduction, but that you do not want in the result.  An example that comes to mind is running a recurrent neural networks (RNN).  In an RNN, we have a function

.. code-block:: python

    def rnn_step(input_data, last_hidden_state):
        """
        :param Array[n_samples,n_input_dim] input_data: The input data at the current time step
        :param Array[n_samples,n_hidden_dim] last_hidden_state: The hidden state from the last time step
        :return Tuple[Array[n_samples,n_output_dim], Array[n_samples,n_hidden_dim]]: The output and hidden state.
        """
        ...  # Compute update here
        return output_data, new_hidden_state


In our new construct, we may run this as:

.. code-block:: python
   output_timeseries = [current_output, hidden = rnn_step(current_input, hidden) for current_input in input_timeseries from hidden=np.zeros((n_samples, n_hidden_dim))]
   
   
Which would return a list of 2-tuples.

However, we generally do not want to keep the hidden values (they are just use to carry forward internal state).  The proposed extension is to enable the optional syntax: 

.. code-block:: python
   output_timeseries = [current_output, hidden = rnn_step(current_input, hidden) -> current_output for current_input in input_timeseries from hidden=np.zeros((n_samples, n_hidden_dim))]

Where the :code:`-> current_output` at the end signifies that we only want to keep the :code:`current_output` at each iteration in the result.

Just as before, if we're only interested in the last output, we can use
   
   
.. code-block:: python
   final_output = last(current_output, hidden = rnn_step(current_input, hidden) -> current_output for current_input in input_timeseries from hidden=np.zeros((n_samples, n_hidden_dim)))
