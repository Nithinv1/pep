Rename 'object` as 'instance' as a hint in an interactive mode.

The word 'object' indicates nothing in interactive mode.

Suppose a class and an instance created from it:

    class Foo(object): pass
    
    foo = Foo()   

Test them in interactive mode:

    In [80]: print(Foo)
    <class '__main__.Foo'>
Good hint, class 'Foo' in first_class module `__main__`,

However,

    In [81]: print(foo)
    
    <__main__.Foo object at 0x10f43b0b8> 

In python, `object` is a metaclass or the class of a class.

Everything is considered as `object`,
so 'object' in  <__main__.Foo object at 0x10f43b0b8> definitely hints you nothing.

There's no advantages to apply the word `object` instead of `instance` to provide a hint.
