Rename 'object` as 'instance' in an address.

The word 'object' indicates nothing in address printed.

Suppose a class and an instance created from it:


    class Foo(object): pass

    foo = Foo()

Test them in interactive mode:


    In [80]: print(Foo)

    <class '__main__.Foo'>


Good hint, class 'Foo' in first_class module `__main__`,

However,


    In [81]: print(foo)

    <__main__.Foo object at 0x10f43b0b8>


In python, `object` is a metaclass or the class of a class.

Everything is considered as `object`,
so 'object' in address `<__main__.Foo object at 0x10f43b0b8>` definitely hints you nothing.

It seems no advantages to apply the word `object` instead of `instance` to provide a hint.
