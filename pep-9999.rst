Abstract
========

This PEP recommends deprecating and then disabling new uploads of the
``bdist_egg`` distribution type on PyPI. In a parallel move, this PEP recommends
deprecating and then disabling new uploads of distribution filenames that have
the ``.egg`` suffix.

It does not recommend removing or otherwise affecting any previously
uploaded ``bdist_egg`` distributions or files with the ``.egg`` suffix.

Rationale
=========

Previous Work
-------------

The groundwork for this proposal was established with :pep:`527`, which
proposed deprecating and eventually removing upload support for a handful
of un(der)used file extensions and distribution types.

In particular, :pep:`527` proposed the removal of the ``bdist_dumb``,
``bdist_rpm``, ``bdist_dmg``, ``bdist_msi``, and ``bdist_wininst`` distribution
types, as well as the ``.tar``, ``.tar.bz2``, ``.tar.xz``, ``.tar.Z``,
``.tgz``, and ``.tbz`` file extensions on distribution filenames.

:pep:`527` was fully enacted with
`PR #7529 <https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/7529>`_ to Warehouse,
which was merged on 13 April 2020.

The ``bdist_egg`` format
------------------------

The ``bdist_egg`` filetype identifies distributions in the
:term:`egg format <packaging:Egg>`. The
egg format was introduced by setuptools in 2004 and is roughly equivalent
in functionality to the
:term:`wheel format <packaging:Wheel>`
first introduced by :pep:`427` in 2012 as the standardized
:ref:`built distribution format <packaging:binary-distribution-format>`.

Despite its longevity, the egg format has had
`limited adoption on PyPI <https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/10653>`_.
Some observations from that issue:

* As of December 2021, ``bdist_egg`` uploads account for less than 1% of all
  built distribution uploads;
* ``pip`` deprecated its ``--egg`` option in 2016;
* ``setuptools`` has considered egg support deprecated since 2019;
* ``build`` only supports the ``sdist`` and ``bdist_wheel`` filetypes.

Given the above, this PEP proposes the removal of the ``bdist_egg`` format
under the same justifications presented in :pep:`527`, namely:

* egg distributions are of of limited use to the broader ecosystem and
  therefore represent a non-reciprocal maintenance burden;
* Continued support for egg distributions represents a bandwidth and storage
  cost to PyPI, as well as to any external mirrors of PyPI.

This PEP *additionally* offers an argument for removal rooted in
standardization and duplication: the egg format is not standardized by any
PEP or other community standard, and overlaps heavily with its standardized
and well-supported alternative (wheel).

The ``.egg`` file extension
---------------------------

The ``.egg`` file extension is used exclusively for distributions of the
``bdist_egg`` format. As such, it serves no purpose in a scenario where
PyPI disables new distribution uploads for ``bdist_egg`` distributions.

Removal Process
===============

This PEP proposes using the same removal process specified in :pep:`527`.
