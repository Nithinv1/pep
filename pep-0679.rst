PEP: 679
Title: A Per-Interpreter GIL
Author: Eric Snow <ericsnowcurrently@gmail.com>
PEP-Delegate: <TBD>
Discussions-To: python-dev@python.org
Status: Draft
Type: Informational
Created: 01-01-2022
Python-Version: 3.11
Post-History: 01-01-2022
Resolution: <TBD>


Abstract
========

CPython has supported multiple interpreters in the same process (AKA
"subinterpreters") since version 1.5 (1997).  The feature has been
available via the C-API. [c-api]_  PEP 554 discusses some of the value of
subinterpreters and the merits of exposing them to Python code.
However, that PEP purposefully avoids discussion about isolation,
especially related to the GIL.  This PEP fills that role.

The more isolation there is between interpreters, the more value they
can offer.  Currently subinterpreters operate in
`relative isolation from one another <Interpreter Isolation_>`_.  If they
were fully isolated then they could operate in parallel on multi-core
hosts.

This proposal identifies a path forward to reach full isolation between
interpreters.  This includes making the GIL per-interpreter.  


Proposal
========

TBD


Motivation
==========

[Clearly explain why the existing language specification is inadequate to address the problem that the PEP solves.]


Rationale
=========

[Describe why particular design decisions were made.]

Concerns
--------

TBD


Specification
=============

[Describe the syntax and semantics of any new language feature.]


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

[Describe potential impact and severity on pre-existing code.]


Alternate Python Implementations
================================

(not affected?  this is CPython-only)


Security Implications
=====================

[How could a malicious user take advantage of this new feature?]


How to Teach This
=================

[How to teach users, new and experienced, how to apply the PEP to their work.]


Documentation
=============

TBD


Deferred Functionality
======================

TBD


Reference Implementation
========================

[Link to any existing implementation and details about its state, e.g. proof-of-concept.]


Rejected Ideas
==============

[Why certain ideas that were brought while discussing this PEP were not ultimately pursued.]


Open Issues
===========

[Any points that are still being decided/discussed.]
