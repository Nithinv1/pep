Abstract
========

This PEP is a placeholder for the Python language governance model voted on
and selected by representatives from the Python community.  The process for
selecting a new governance model in the wake of `Guido's retirement
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005664.html>`_
is outlined in PEP 8000.

This PEP both describes the new model and names duly elected officeholders.
It maintains the history of those officeholders.
