Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a new optional mode of operation for CPython's cyclic
garbage collector (GC) where implicit (i.e. opportunistic) collections
happen in a dedicated thread rather than synchronously.


Terminology
===========

An "implicit" GC run (or "implicit" collection) is one that is triggered
opportunistically based on a certain heuristic computed over allocation
statistics, whenever a new allocation is requested.  Details of the
heuristic are not relevant to this PEP, as it does not propose to change it.

An "explicit" GC run (or "explicit" collection) is one that is requested
programmatically by an API call such as ``gc.collect``.

"Threaded" refers to the fact that GC runs happen in a dedicated thread
separate from sequential execution of application code.  It does not mean
"concurrent" (the Global Interpreter Lock, or GIL, still serializes
execution among Python threads *including* the dedicated GC thread)
nor "parallel" (the GC is not able to distribute its work onto several
threads at once to lower wall-clock latencies of GC runs).


Rationale
=========

The mode of operation for the GC has always been to perform implicit
collections synchronously.  That is, whenever the aforementioned heuristic
is activated, execution of application code in the current thread is
suspended and the GC is launched in order to reclaim dead reference
cycles.

There is a catch, though.  Over the course of reclaiming dead reference
cycles (and any ancillary objects hanging at those cycles), the GC can
execute arbitrary finalization code in the form of ``__del__`` methods
and ``weakref`` callbacks.  Over the years, Python has been used for more
and more sophisticated purposes, and it is increasinly common for
finalization code to perform complex tasks, for example in distributed
systems where loss of an object may require notifying other (logical
or physical) nodes.

Interrupting application code at arbitrary points to execute finalization
code that may rely on a consistent internal state and/or on acquiring
synchronization primitives give rise to reentrancy issues that even the
most seasoned experts have trouble fixing properly [1]_.

This PEP bases itself on the observation that, despite the apparent
similarities, same-thread reentrancy is a fundamentally harder
problem than multi-thread synchronization.  Instead of letting each
developer or library author struggle with extremely hard reentrancy
issues, one by one, this PEP proposes to allow the GC to run in a
separate thread where well-known multi-thread synchronization practices
are sufficient.


Proposal
========

Under this PEP, the GC has two modes of operation:

* "serial", which is the default and legacy mode, where an implicit GC
  run is performed immediately in the thread that detects such an implicit
  run is desired (based on the aforementioned allocation heuristic).

* "threaded", which can be explicitly enabled at runtime on a per-process
  basis, where implicit GC runs are *scheduled* whenever the allocation
  heuristic is triggered, but run in a dedicated background thread.

Hard reentrancy problems which plague sophisticated uses of finalization
callbacks in the "serial" mode become relatively easy multi-thread
synchronization problems in the "threaded" mode of operation.

The GC also traditionally allows for explicit GC runs, using the Python
API ``gc.collect`` and the C API ``PyGC_Collect``.  The visible semantics
of these two APIs are left unchanged: they perform a GC run immediately
when called, and only return when the GC run is finished.


New public APIs
===============

Two new Python APIs are added to the ``gc`` module:

* ``gc.set_mode(mode)`` sets the current mode of operation (either "serial"
  or "threaded").  If setting to "serial" and the current mode is
  "threaded", then the function also waits for the GC thread to end.

* ``gc.get_mode()`` returns the current mode of operation.

It is allowed to switch back and forth between modes of operation.


Intended use
============

Given the per-process nature of the switch and its repercussions on
semantics of all finalization callbacks, it is recommended that it is
set at the beginning of an application's code (and/or in initializers
for child processes e.g. when using ``multiprocessing``).  Library functions
should probably not mess with this setting, just as they shouldn't call
``gc.enable`` or ``gc.disable``, but there's nothing to prevent them from
doing so.


Internal details
================

``gc`` module
-------------

An internal flag ``gc_is_threaded`` is added, telling whether GC is serial
or threaded.

An internal structure ``gc_mutex`` is added to avoid two GC runs at once:

.. code-block:: c

   static struct {
       PyThread_type_lock collecting;  /* taken when collecting */
       PyThreadState *owner;  /* whichever thread is currently collecting
                                 (NULL if no collection is taking place) */
   } gc_mutex;

An internal structure ``gc_thread`` is added to handle synchronization with
the GC thread:

.. code-block:: c

   static struct {
      PyThread_type_lock wakeup; /* acts as an event
                                    to wake up the GC thread */
      int collection_requested; /* non-zero if collection requested */
      PyThread_type_lock done; /* acts as an event signaling
                                  the GC thread has exited */
   } gc_thread;


``threading`` module
--------------------

Two private functions are added to the ``threading`` module:

* ``threading._ensure_dummy_thread(name)`` creates and registers a ``Thread``
  instance for the current thread with the given *name*, and returns it.

* ``threading._remove_dummy_thread(thread)`` removes the given *thread*
  (as returned by ``_ensure_dummy_thread``) from the threading module's
  internal state.

The purpose of these two functions is to improve debugging and introspection
by letting ``threading.current_thread()`` return a more meaningfully-named
object when called inside a finalization callback in the GC thread.


Pseudo-code
===========

Here is a proposed pseudo-code for the main primitives, public and internal,
required for implementing this PEP.  All of them will be implemented in C
and live inside the ``gc`` module, unless otherwise noted:

.. code-block:: python

   def collect_with_callback(generation):
       """
       Collect up to the given *generation*.

       Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS
       gc_mutex.owner = me

           else:

Discussion
==========

Default mode
------------

One may wonder whether the default mode should simply be changed to "threaded".
For multi-threaded applications, it would probably not be a problem:
those applications must already be prepared for finalization handlers to
be run in arbitrary threads.  In single-thread applications, however, it
is currently guaranteed that finalizers will always be called in the main
thread.  Breaking this property may induce subtle behaviour changes or bugs,
for example if finalizers rely on some thread-local values.

Explicit collections
--------------------

One may ask why explicit collections should not also be delegated to the
background thread.  The answer is it doesn't really matter: since
``gc.collect`` and ``PyGC_Collect`` actually *wait* for the collection to
end (breaking this property would break compatibility), delegating the
actual work to a background thread wouldn't ease synchronization with the
thread requesting an explicit collection.

In the end, this PEP choses the behaviour that seems simpler to implement
based on the pseudo-code above.


Open issues
===========

``gc.set_mode`` should probably be protected against multiple concurrent
invocations.  Also, it should raise when called from *inside* a GC run
(i.e. from a finalizer).


Implementation
==============

No actual implementation exists as of yet.
