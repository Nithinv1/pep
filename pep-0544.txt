Abstract
========

Type hints introduced in PEP 484 can be used to specify type metadata
for static type checkers and other third party tools. However, PEP 484
only specifies the semantics of *nominal* subtyping. In this PEP we specify
static and runtime semantics of protocol classes that will provide a support
for *structural* subtyping (static duck typing).


.. _rationale:

Rationale and Goals
===================

Currently, PEP 484 and the ``typing`` module [typing]_ define abstract
base classes for several common Python protocols such as ``Iterable`` and
``Sized``. The problem with them is that a class has to be explicitly marked
to support them, which is unpythonic and unlike what one would
normally do in idiomatic dynamically typed Python code. For example,
this conforms to PEP 484::

  from typing import Sized, Iterable, Iterator

  class Bucket(Sized, Iterable[int]):
      ...
      def __len__(self) -> int: ...
      def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[int]: ...

The same problem appears with user-defined ABCs: they must be explicitly
subclassed or registered. This is particularly difficult to do with library
types as the type objects may be hidden deep in the implementation
of the library. Moreover, extensive use of ABCs might impose additional
runtime costs.

The intention of this PEP is to solve all these problems
by allowing users to write the above code without explicit base classes in
the class definition, allowing ``Bucket`` to be implicitly considered
a subtype of both ``Sized`` and ``Iterable[int]`` by static type checkers
using structural [wiki-structural]_ subtyping::

  from typing import Iterator, Iterable

  class Bucket:
      ...
      def __len__(self) -> int: ...
      def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[int]: ...

  def collect(items: Iterable[int]) -> int: ...
  result: int = collect(Bucket())  # Passes type check

The same functionality will be provided for user-defined protocols, as
specified below. The above code with a protocol class matches common Python
conventions much better. It is also automatically extensible and works
with additional, unrelated classes that happen to implement
the required protocol.


Nominal vs structural subtyping
-------------------------------

Structural subtyping is natural for Python programmers since it matches
the runtime semantics of duck typing: an object that has certain properties
is treated independently of its actual runtime class.
However, as discussed in PEP 483, both nominal and structural
subtyping have their strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, in this PEP we
*do not propose* to replace the nominal subtyping described by PEP 484 with
structural subtyping completely. Instead, protocol classes as specified in
this PEP complement normal classes, and users are free to choose
where to apply a particular solution. See section on `rejected`_ ideas at the
end of this PEP for additional motivation.


Non-goals
---------

At runtime, protocol classes will be simple ABCs. There is no intent to
provide sophisticated runtime instance and class checks against protocol
classes. This would be difficult and error-prone and will contradict the logic
of PEP 484. As well, following PEP 484 and PEP 526 we state that protocols are
**completely optional** and there is no intent to make them required.
No runtime semantics will be imposed for variables or parameters annotated
with a protocol class. The actual checks will be performed by third-party type
checkers and other tools.


Existing Approaches to Structural Subtyping
===========================================

Before describing the actual specification, we review and comment on existing
approaches related to structural subtyping in Python and other languages:

* Zope interfaces [zope-interfaces]_ was one of the first widely used
  approaches to structural subtyping in Python. It is implemented by providing
  special classes to distinguish interface classes from normal classes,
  to mark interface attributes, and to explicitly declare implementation.
  For example::

    from zope.interface import Interface, Attribute, implements

    class IEmployee(Interface):

        name = Attribute("Name of employee")

        def do(work):
            """Do some work"""

    class Employee(object):
        implements(IEmployee)

        name = 'Anonymous'

        def do(self, work):
            return work.start()

  Zope interfaces support various contracts and constraints for interface
  classes. For example::

    from zope.interface import invariant

    def required_contact(obj):
        if not (obj.email or obj.phone):
            raise Exception("At least one contact info is required")

    class IPerson(Interface):

        name = Attribute("Name")
        email = Attribute("Email Address")
        phone = Attribute("Phone Number")

        invariant(required_contact)

  Even more detailed invariants are supported. However, Zope interfaces rely
  entirely on runtime validation. Such focus on runtime properties goes
  beyond the scope of the current proposal, and static support for invariants
  might be difficult to implement. However, the idea of marking an interface
  class with a special base class is reasonable and easy to implement both
  statically and at runtime.

* Python abstract base classes [abstract-classes]_ are the standard
  library tool to provide some functionality similar to structural subtyping.
  The drawback of this approach is the necessity to either subclass
  the abstract class or register an implementation explicitly::

    from abc import ABC

    class MyTuple(ABC):
        pass

    MyTuple.register(tuple)

    assert issubclass(tuple, MyTuple)
    assert isinstance((), MyTuple)

  As mentioned in the `rationale`_, we want to avoid such necessity, especially
  in static context. However, in a runtime context, ABCs are good candidates for
  protocol classes and they are already used extensively in
  the ``typing`` module.

* Abstract classes defined in ``collections.abc`` module [collections-abc]_
  are slightly more advanced since they implement a custom
  ``__subclasshook__()`` method that allows runtime structural checks without
  explicit registration::

    from collections.abc import Iterable

    class MyIterable:
        def __iter__(self):
            return []

    assert isinstance(MyIterable(), Iterable)

  This seems to be a perfect fit for both runtime and static behavior of
  protocols. The main goal of this proposal is to support such behavior
  statically. In addition, to allow users achieving such runtime behavior
  for user defined protocols a ``__subclasshook__()`` that mimics the one in
  ``collections.abc`` can be automatically added,
  see detailed `discussion`_ below.

* TypeScript [typescript]_ provides support for user defined classes and
  interfaces. Explicit implementation declaration is not required and
  structural subtyping is verified statically. For example::

    interface LabeledItem {
        label: string;
        size?: int;
    }

    function printLabel(obj: LabeledValue) {
        console.log(obj.label);
    }

    let myObj = {size: 10, label: "Size 10 Object"};
    printLabel(myObj);

  Note that optional interface members are supported. Also, TypeScript
  prohibits redundant members in implementations. While the idea of
  optional members looks interesting, it would complicate this proposal and
  it is not clear how useful it will be. Therefore it is proposed to postpone
  this; see `rejected`_ ideas. In general, the idea of static protocol
  checking without runtime implications looks reasonable, and basically
  this proposal follows the same line.

* Go [golang]_ uses a more radical approach and makes interfaces the primary
  way to provide type information. Also, assignments are used to explicitly
  ensure implementation::

    type SomeInterface interface {
        SomeMethod() ([]byte, error)
    }

    if _, ok := someval.(SomeInterface); ok {
        fmt.Printf("value implements some interface")
    }

  Both these ideas are questionable in the context of this proposal. See
  the section on `rejected`_ ideas.


.. _specification:

Specification
=============

Terminology
-----------

We propose to use the term *protocols* for types supporting structural
subtyping. The reason is that the term *iterator protocol*,
for example, is widely understood in the community, and coming up with
a new term for this concept in a statically typed context would just create
confusion.

This has the drawback that the term *protocol* becomes overloaded with
two subtly different meanings: the first is the traditional, well-known but
slightly fuzzy concept of protocols such as iterator; the second is the more
explicitly defined concept of protocols in statically typed code.
The distinction is not important most of the time, and in other
cases we propose to just add a qualifier such as *protocol classes*
when referring to the static type concept.

If a class includes a protocol in its MRO, the class is called
an *explicit* subclass of the protocol. If a class is a structural subtype
of a protocol, it is said to implement the protocol and to be compatible
with a protocol. If a class is compatible with a protocol but the protocol
is not included in the MRO, the class is an *implicit* subtype
of the protocol.

The attributes (variables and methods) of a protocol that are mandatory
for other class in order to be considered a structural subtype are called
protocol members. Other members defined in a protocol class are called
non-protocol members.


.. _definition:

Defining a protocol
-------------------

Protocols are defined by including a special new class ``typing.Protocol``
(an instance of ``abc.ABCMeta``) in the base classes list, preferably
at the beginning of the list. Here is a simple example::

  from typing import Protocol

  class SupportsClose(Protocol):
      @abstractmethod
      def close(self) -> None:
          ...

Now if one defines a class ``Resource`` with a ``close()`` method that has
a compatible signature, it would implicitly be a subtype of
``SupportsClose``, since the structural subtyping is used for
protocol types::

  class Resource:
      ...
      def close(self) -> None:
          self.file.close()
          self.lock.release()

Apart from few restrictions explicitly mentioned below, protocol types can
be used in every context where a normal types can::

  def close_all(things: Iterable[SupportsClose]) -> None:
      for t in things:
          t.close()

  f = open('foo.txt')
  r = Resource()
  close_all([f, r])  # OK!
  close_all([1])     # Error: 'int' has no 'close' method

Note that both the user-defined class ``Resource`` and the built-in
``IO`` type (the return type of ``open()``) are considered subtypes of
``SupportsClose``, because they provide a ``close()`` method with
a compatible type signature.


Protocol members
----------------

The methods that are protocol members are defined using the
``@abstractmethod`` decorator. Such methods can have a default
implementation that will be type checked. Method body can be left empty,
i.e. be either only a docstring or a single ``...`` ellipsis literal.
In this case type checkers will recognize that there is no default
implementation, i.e. it can't be used via ``super()`` in explicit
subclasses.

If some or all parameters of protocol method are not annotated
their types are assumed to be ``Any`` (see PEP 484). All other
methods defined in the protocol class are considered non-protocol members.
Example::

  from typing import Protocol

  class Example(Protocol):
      @abstractmethod
      def first(self) -> int:     # This is a protocol member
          return 1

      @abstractmethod
      def second(self) -> int:    # This one also
          ...

      def auxiliary(self) -> str: # This is NOT a protocol member
          x = 1

Note that although formally the implicit return type of a method with
an empty body is ``None``, type checker will not warn about above example,
such convention mirrors how methods are defined in stub files.
Abstract staticmethods, abstract classmethods, and abstract properties are
equally supported.

To define a protocol variable, one must use PEP 526 variable
annotations in the class body. Attributes defined in the body of a method
by assignment via ``self`` are considered non-protocol members. The rationale
for this is that the protocol class implementation is often not shared by
subtypes, so the interface should not depend on the default implementation.
An exception from these rules is an attribute starting with double
underscores and not ending with double underscores always considered
non-protocol member. Examples::

  from typing import Protocol, List

  class Template(Protocol):
      name: str        # This is a protocol member
      value: int = 0   # This one too (with default)
      __private: bool  # This is NOT a protocol member

      def method(self) -> None:
          self.temp: List[int] = [] # And this one neither

To distinguish between protocol class variables and protocol instance
variables, the special ``ClassVar`` annotation should be used as specified
by PEP 526.


Explicitly declaring implementation
-----------------------------------

To explicitly declare that a certain class implements the given protocols, they
can be used as regular base classes. In this case:

* A class could use implementations of some methods in protocols, both
  protocol members with default implementations and non-protocol members
  (``typing.Sequence`` is an example with useful default methods).
  In particular, a protocol could provide a default implementation of
  ``__init__`` that could be used in explicit subclasses.
  The default implementations can not be used if the subtype relationship
  is implicit and only via structural subtyping -- the semantics of
  inheritance is not changed. Examples::

    from typing import Protocol

    class PColor(Protocol):
        @abstractmethod
        def draw(self) -> str:
            ...
        @abstractmethod
        def with_int(self, x: int) -> int:
            return 42

        def complex_method(self) -> int:
            ...
            # some complex code here

    class SimpleColor(PColor):
        def draw(self) -> str:
            return super().draw()  # Error, no default implementation

        def with_int(self, x: int) -> int:
            return super().with_int(x) + x

        def other_method(self) -> None:
            x = super().complex_method()
            ...

    simple: SimpleColor
    def represent(c: PColor) -> None:
        ...
    represent(simple) # OK

* Type checkers might statically enforce that the class actually
  implements the protocol correctly::

    from typing import Protocol, Tuple

    class RGB(Protocol):
        rgb: Tuple[int, int, int]

        @abstractmethod
        def intensity(self) -> int:
            ...
        @abstractmethod
        def to_bytes(self) -> bytes:
            return b''

    class Point(RGB):
        def __init__(self, red: int, green: int, blue: str) -> None:
            self.rgb = red, green, blue  # Error, 'blue' must be 'int'

        def to_bytes(self) -> bytes:
            return super().to_bytes()

        # Type checker might warn that 'intensity' is not defined

The general philosophy is that protocols are mostly like regular ABCs,
but a static type checker will handle them specially. Subclassing a protocol
class would not turn the subclass into a protocol unless it also has
``typing.Protocol`` as an explicit base class. Without this base, subclassing
"downgrades" the class to a regular ABC that cannot be used with structural
subtyping. See section on `extending`_ for details of defining subprotocols.

A class can explicitly inherit from multiple protocols.
In this case methods are resolved using normal MRO and the type checker
verifies that all subtyping are correct. Note that a concrete method with
appropriate type signature can override a protocol method but not vice versa.
Examples::

  class A(Protocol):
      @abstractmethod
      def m(self) -> str: ...
      @abstractmethod
      def foo(self) -> int: ...

  class B(Protocol):
      def m(self) -> str:
         return 'non abstract'
      @abstractmethod
      def bar(self) -> str: ...

  class C(A, B): # Fails typecheck, protocol member 'A.m' can't override 'B.m'
      ...
  class D(B, A): # OK
      def bar(self) -> str:
          return 'bar'
      # Error, 'foo' is not implemented (although 'm' is not needed here).


.. _extending :

Merging and extending protocols
-------------------------------

Subprotocols are also supported. A subprotocol can be defined
by having both one or more protocols as immediate base classes and also
having ``typing.Protocol`` as an immediate base class::

  from typing import Sized, Protocol

  class SizedAndCloseable(Sized, Protocol):
      @abstractmethod
      def close(self) -> None:
          ...

Now the protocol ``SizedAndCloseable`` is a protocol with two methods,
``__len__`` and ``close``. Alternatively, one can implement it
like this, assuming the existence of ``SupportsClose`` from
the example in `definition`_ section::

  from typing import Sized

  class SupportsClose(...): ...  # Like above

  class SizedAndCloseable(Sized, SupportsClose, Protocol):
      pass

The two definitions of ``SizedAndClosable`` are equivalent.
Subclass relationships between protocols are not meaningful when
considering subtyping, since structural compatibility is
the criterion, not the MRO.

If one omits ``Protocol`` in the base class list, this would be a regular
(non-protocol) class that must implement ``Sized``. If ``Protocol``
is included in the base class list, all the other base classes
must be protocols. A protocol can't extend a regular class.

Note that rules around explicit subclassing are different from regular ABCs,
where abstractness is simply defined by having at least one abstract method
being unimplemented. Protocol classes must be marked *explicitly*.


Generic and recursive protocols
-------------------------------

Generic protocols are important. For example, ``SupportsAbs``, ``Iterable``
and ``Iterator`` are generic protocols. They are defined similar to normal
non-protocol generic types::

  T = TypeVar('T', covariant=True)

  class Iterable(Protocol[T]):
      @abstractmethod
      def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[T]:
          ...

Note that ``Protocol[T, S, ...]`` is allowed as a shorthand for
``Protocol, Generic[T, S, ...]``.

Recursive protocols are also supported. Forward references to the protocol
class names can be given as strings as specified by PEP 484. Recursive
protocols will be useful for representing self-referential data structures
like trees in an abstract fashion::

  class Traversable(Protocol):
      leafs: Iterable['Traversable']


Using Protocols
===============

Subtyping relationships with other types
----------------------------------------

Protocols cannot be instantiated, so there are no values with
protocol types. For variables and parameters with protocol types, subtyping
relationships are subject to the following rules:

* A protocol is never a subtype of a concrete type.
* A concrete type or a protocol ``X`` is a subtype of another protocol ``P``
  if and only if ``X`` implements all protocol members of ``P``. In other
  words, subtyping with respect to a protocol is always structural.
* Edge case: for recursive protocols, structural subtyping is decided
  positively for situations where such decision depends on itself. Continuing
  the previous example::

    class Tree(Generic[T]):
        def __init__(self, value: T,
                           leafs: 'List[Tree[T]]') -> None:
            self.value = value
            self.leafs = leafs

    def walk(graph: Traversable) -> None:
        ...
    tree: Tree[float] = Tree(0, [])
    walk(tree) # OK, 'Tree[float]' is a subtype of 'Traversable'

Generic protocol types follow the same rules of variance as non-protocol
types. Protocols can be used in all special type constructors provided
by the ``typing`` module and follow the corresponding subtyping rules.
For example, protocol ``PInt`` is a subtype of ``Union[PInt, int]``.


``Union[]`` and ``All[]``
-------------------------

``Union`` of protocol classes behaves the same way as for non-protocol
classes. For example::

  from typing import Union, Optional, Protocol

  class Exitable(Protocol):
      @abstracrmethod
      def exit(self) -> int:
          ...
  class Quitable(Protocol):
      @abstractmethod
      def quit(self) -> Optional[int]:
          ...

  def finish(task: Union[Exitable, Quitable]) -> int:
      ...
  class GoodJob:
      ...
      def quit(self) -> int:
          return 0
  finish(GoodJob()) # OK

In addition, we propose to add another special type construct
``All`` that represents intersection types. Although for normal types
it is not very useful, there are many situations where a variable should
implement more than one protocol. Annotation by ``All[Proto1, Proto2, ...]``
means that a given variable or parameter must implement all protocols
``Proto1``, ``Proto2``, etc. either implicitly or explicitly. Example::

  from typing import Sequence, Hashable, All

  def cached_func(args: All[Sequence[float], Hashable]) -> float:
      ...
  cached_func((1, 2, 3)) # OK, tuple is hashable and sequence

The interaction between union and intersection types is specified by PEP 483,
and basically reflects the corresponding interactions for sets.


``Type[]`` with protocols
-------------------------

Variables and parameters annotated with ``Type[Proto]`` accept only concrete
(non-protocol) subtypes of ``Proto``. For example::

  class Proto(Protocol):
      @abstractmethod
      def meth(self) -> int:
          ...
  class Concrete:
      def meth(self) -> int:
          return 42

  def fun(cls: Type[Proto]) -> int:
      return cls().meth() # OK
  fun(Proto)              # Error
  fun(Concrete)           # OK

The same rule applies to variables::

  var: Type[Proto]
  var = Proto    # Error
  var = Concrete # OK
  var().meth()   # OK

Assigning a protocol class to a variable is allowed if it is not explicitly
typed, and such assignment creates a type alias. For non-protocol classes,
the behavior of ``Type[]`` is not changed.


``NewType()`` and type aliases
------------------------------

Protocols are essentially anonymous. To emphasize this point, static type
checkers might refuse protocol classes inside ``NewType()`` to avoid an
illusion that a distinct type is provided::

  form typing import NewType , Protocol, Iterator

  class Id(Protocol):
      code: int
      secrets: Iterator[bytes]

  UserId = NewType('UserId', Id)  # Error, can't provide distinct type

On the contrary, type aliases are fully supported, including generic type
aliases::

  from typing import TypeVar, Reversible, Iterable, Sized

  T = TypeVar('T')
  CompatReversible = Union[Reversible[T], All[Iterable[T], Sized]]


.. _discussion:

Narrowing types by ``isinstance()``
-----------------------------------

Protocol types will implement special instance and class checks, similar to
how ``Iterable`` and other ABCs in ``collections.abc`` and ``typing`` already
do it, but this is limited to non-generic and unsubscripted generic protocols
(``Iterable`` is statically equivalent to ``Iterable[Any]`).
The metaclass of ``typing.Protocol`` will automatically add
a ``__subclasshook__()`` that provides the same semantics
for class and instance checks as for ``collections.abc`` classes::

  from typing import runtime, Protocol

  class Closeable(Protocol):
      @abstractmethod
      def close(self):
          ...

  assert isinstance(open('some/file'), Closeable)

Static type checkers will understand ``isinstance(x, Proto)`` and
``issubclass(C, Proto)`` for protocols (as they already do
for ``Iterable`` etc.). Static type checkers will narrow types after such
checks by the type erased ``Proto`` (i.e. with all variables having type
``Any`` and all methods having type ``Callable[..., Any]``).
Note that ``isinstance(x, Proto[int])`` etc. will always fail in agreement
with PEP 484. Examples::

  from typing import Iterable, Iterator, Sequence

  def process(items: Iterable[int]) -> None:
      if isinstance(items, Iterator):
          # 'items' have type 'Iterator[int]' here
      elif isinstance(items, Sequence[int]):
          # Error! Can't use 'isinstance()' with subscripted protocols


Using Protocols in Python 3.5 and Earlier
=========================================

Variable annotation syntax was added in Python 3.6, so that the syntax
for defining protocol variables proposed in `specification`_ section can't
be used in earlier versions. To define these in earlier versions of Python
one can use abstract properties::

  class Foo(Protocol):
      @abstractproperty
      def c(self) -> int: ...

      @abstractproperty
      def c(self) -> int:   # Default value can be provided for property.
          return 0

      @property
      def e(self) -> int:   # Note, this is not a protocol member.
          return 0

The ``typing`` module changes proposed in this PEP will be also
backported to earlier versions via the backport currently available on PyPI.


Runtime Implementation of Protocol Classes
==========================================

Implementation details
----------------------

The runtime implementation could be done in pure Python without any
effects on the core interpreter and standard library except in the
``typing`` module:

* Define class ``typing.Protocol`` similar to ``typing.Generic``.
* Implement metaclass functionality to detect whether a class is
  a protocol or not. Add a class attribute ``__protocol__ = True``
  if that is the case. Verify that a protocol class only has protocol
  base classes in the MRO (except for object).
* Makes ``isinstance()`` behave as for ``collections.abc`` by adding all
  abstract methods and all variables from ``__annotations__`` to
  ``__subclsshook__()``.
* In the backported version of ``typing``, translate ``...`` class attribute
  values to properties.
* All structural subtyping checks will be performed by static type checkers,
  such as ``mypy`` [mypy]_. No additional support for protocol validation will
  be provided at runtime.


Changes in the typing module
----------------------------

The following classes in ``typing`` module will be protocols:

* ``Hashable``
* ``SupportsAbs`` (and other ``Supports*`` classes)
* ``Iterable``, ``Iterator``
* ``Sized``
* ``Container``
* ``Collection``
* ``Reversible``
* ``Sequence``, ``MutableSequence``
* ``AbstractSet``, ``MutableSet``
* ``Mapping``, ``MutableMapping``
* ``ItemsView`` (and other ``*View`` classes)
* ``AsyncIterable``, ``AsyncIterator``
* ``Awaitable``
* ``Callable``
* ``ContextManager``, ``AsyncContextManager``

Most of these classes are small and conceptually simple. It is easy to see
what are the methods these protocols implement, and immediately recognize
the corresponding runtime protocol counterpart.
Practically, few changes will be needed in ``typing`` since some of these
classes already behave the necessary way at runtime. Most of these will need
to be updated only in the corresponding ``typeshed`` stubs [typeshed]_.

All other concrete generic classes such as ``List``, ``Set``, ``IO``,
``Deque``, etc are sufficiently complex that it makes sense to keep
them non-protocols (i.e. require code to be explicit about them). Also, it is
too easy to leave some methods unimplemented by accident, and explicitly
marking the subclass relationship allows type checkers to pinpoint the missing
implementations.


Introspection
-------------

The existing class introspection machinery (``dir``, ``__annotations__`` etc)
can be used with protocols. In addition, all introspection tools implemented
in the ``typing`` module will support protocols. Since all attributes need
to be defined in the class body based on this proposal, protocol classes will
have even better perspective for introspection than regular classes where
attributes can be defined implicitly -- protocol attributes can't be
initialized in ways that are not visible to introspection
(using ``setattr()``, assignment via ``self``, etc.). Still, some things like
types of attributes will not be visible at runtime in Python 3.5 and earlier,
but this looks like a reasonable limitation.

There will be only limited support of ``isinstance()`` and ``issubclass()``
as discussed above (these will *always* fail with ``TypeError`` for
subscripted generic protocols, since a reliable answer could not be given
at runtime in this case). But together with other introspection tools this
give a reasonable perspective for runtime type checking tools.

Rejected/Postponed Ideas
========================

Make every class a protocol by default
--------------------------------------

Some languages such as Go make structural subtyping the only or the primary
form of subtyping. We could achieve a similar result by making all classes
protocols by default (or even always). However we believe that it is better
to require classes to be explicitly marked as protocols, for the following
reasons:

* Protocols don't have some properties of regular classes. In particular,
  ``isinstance()`` is not always well-defined for protocols, whereas it is
  well-defined (and quite commonly used) for regular classes.
* Protocol classes should generally not have many method implementations,
  as they describe an interface, not an implementation.
  Most classes have many implementations, making them bad protocol classes.
* Experience suggests that many classes are not practical as protocols anyway,
  mainly because their interfaces are too large, complex or
  implementation-oriented (for example, they may include de facto
  private attributes and methods without a ``__`` prefix).
* Most actually useful protocols in existing Python code seem to be implicit.
  The ABCs in ``typing`` and ``collections.abc`` are rather an exception, but
  even they are recent additions to Python and most programmers
  do not use them yet.


Support optional protocol members
---------------------------------

We can come up with examples where it would be handy to be able to say
that a method or data attribute does not need to be present in a class
implementing a protocol, but if it is present, it must conform to a specific
signature or type. One could use a ``hasattr()`` check to determine whether
they can use the attribute on a particular instance.

Languages such as TypeScript have similar features and
apparently they are pretty commonly used. The current realistic potential
use cases for protocols in Python don't require these. In the interest
of simplicity, we propose to not support optional methods or attributes.
We can always revisit this later if there is an actual need.


Make protocols interoperable with other approaches
--------------------------------------------------

The protocols as described here are basically a minimal extension to
the existing concept of ABCs. We argue that this is the way they should
be understood, instead of as something that replaces Zope interfaces,
for example. Attempting such interoperabilities will significantly
complicate both the concept and the implementation.


Use assignments to check explicitly that a class implements a protocol
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In Go language the explicit checks for implementation are performed
via dummy assignments [golang]_. Such a way is also possible with the
current proposal. Example::

  class A:
      def __len__(self) -> float:
          return ...

  _: Sized = A()  # Error: A.__len__ doesn't conform to 'Sized'
                  # (Incompatible return type 'float')

This approach moves the check away from
the class definition and it almost requires a comment as otherwise
the code probably would not make any sense to an average reader
-- it looks like dead code. Besides, in the simplest form it requires one
to construct an instance of ``A``, which could be problematic if this requires
accessing or allocating some resources such as files or sockets.
We could work around the latter by using a cast, for example, but then
the code would be ugly. Therefore we discourage the use of this pattern.
