Contributing Guidelines
=======================

To learn more about the purpose of PEPs and how to go about writing a PEP, please
start reading at PEP 1 (pep-0001.txt in this repo). Note that PEP 0, the index PEP,
is now automatically generated, and not committed to the repo.

Before writing a new PEP
========================

Start with a discussion in [python-ideas](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-ideas)
mailing list to determine if the idea is PEP-able. More details about it in
[PEP 1](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/#start-with-an-idea-for-python).


Commit messages
===============

When committing to a PEP, please always include the PEP number in the subject
title. For example, `PEP NNN: <summary of changes>`.
