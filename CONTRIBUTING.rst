Contributing Guidelines
=======================

To learn more about the purpose of PEPs and how to go about writing a PEP, please
start reading at PEP 1 (`pep-0001.txt <./pep-0001.txt>`_ in this repo). Note that
PEP 0, the index PEP, is now automatically generated, and not committed to the repo.

Before writing a new PEP
------------------------

Has this idea been proposed on `python-ideas <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-ideas>`_
and received general acceptance as being an idea worth pursuing? (if not then
please start a discussion there before submitting a pull request).

More details about it in `PEP 1 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/#start-with-an-idea-for-python>`_.

Do you have an implementation of your idea? (this is important for when you
propose this PEP to `python-dev <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev>`_
as code maintenance is a critical aspect of all PEP proposals prior to a
final decision; in special circumstances an implementation can be deferred)


Commit messages
---------------

When committing to a PEP, please always include the PEP number in the subject
title. For example, ``PEP NNN: <summary of changes>``.
