Contributing Guidelines
=======================

To learn more about the purpose of PEPs and how to go about writing a PEP, please
start reading at PEP 1 (`pep-0001.txt <./pep-0001.txt>`_ in this repo). Note that
PEP 0, the index PEP, is now automatically generated, and not committed to the repo.

Before writing a new PEP
------------------------

Start with a discussion in `python-ideas <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-ideas>`_
mailing list to determine if the idea is PEP-able. More details about it in
`PEP 1 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/#start-with-an-idea-for-python>`_.


Commit messages
---------------

When committing to a PEP, please always include the PEP number in the subject
title. For example, ``PEP NNN: <summary of changes>``.

---------------

All interactions for this project are covered by the
`PSF Code of Conduct <https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/>`_. Everyone is
