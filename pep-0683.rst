Abstract
========

Currently the CPython runtime maintains a
`small amount of mutable state <Runtime Object State_>`_ in the
allocated memory of each object.  Because of this, otherwise immutable
objects are actually mutable.  This can have a large negative impact
on CPU and memory performance, especially for approaches to increasing
Python's scalability.  The solution proposed here provides a way
to mark an object as one for which that per-object
runtime state should not change.

Specifically, if an object's refcount matches a very specific value
(defined below) then that object is treated as "immortal".  If an object
is immortal then its refcount will never be modified by ``Py_INCREF()``,
etc.  Consequently, the refcount will never reach 0, so that object will
never be cleaned up (unless explicitly done, e.g. during runtime
finalization).  Additionally, all other per-object runtime state
for an immortal object will be considered immutable.

This approach has some possible negative impact, which is explained
below, along with mitigations.  The fundamental improvement is that
now an object can be truly immutable.

(This proposal is meant to be CPython-specific and to affect only
internal implementation details.  There are some slight exceptions
to that which are explained below.)


Motivation
==========

As noted above, currently all objects are effectively mutable.  That
includes "immutable" objects like ``str`` instances.  This is because
every object's refcount is frequently modified as the object is used
during execution.  This is especially significant for a number of
commonly used global (builtin) objects, e.g. ``None``.  Such objects
are used a lot, both in Python code and internally.  That adds up to
a consistent high volume of refcount changes.

The effective mutability of all Python objects has a concrete impact
on parts of the Python community, e.g. projects that aim for
scalability like Instragram or the effort to make the GIL
per-interpreter.  Below we describe several ways in which refcount
modification has a real negative effect on such projects.
None of that would happen for objects that are truly immutable.

Reducing CPU Cache Invalidation
-------------------------------

Every modification of a refcount causes the corresponding CPU cache
line to be invalidated.  This has a number of effects.

For one, the write must be propagated to other cache levels
and to main memory.  This has small effect on all Python programs.
Immortal objects would provide a slight relief in that regard.

On top of that, multi-core applications pay a price.  If two threads
are interacting with the same object (e.g. ``None``)  then they will
end up invalidating each other's caches with each incref and decref.
This is true even for otherwise immutable objects like ``True``,
``0``, and ``str`` instances.  This is also true even with
the GIL, though the impact is smaller.

Avoiding Data Races
-------------------

Speaking of multi-core, we are considering making the GIL
a per-interpreter lock, which would enable true multi-core parallelism.
Among other things, the GIL currently protects against races between
multiple concurrent threads that may incref or decref the same object.
Without a shared GIL, two running interpreters could not safely share
any objects, even otherwise immutable ones like ``None``.

This means that, to have a per-interpreter GIL, each interpreter must
have its own copy of *every* object.  That includes the singletons and
static types.  We have a viable strategy for that but it will require
a meaningful amount of extra effort and extra complexity.

The alternative is to ensure that all shared objects are truly immutable.
There would be no races because there would be no modification.  This
is something that the immortality proposed here would enable for
otherwise immutable objects.  With immortal objects,
support for a per-interpreter GIL
becomes much simpler.

Avoiding Copy-on-Write
----------------------

For some applications it makes sense to get the application into
a desired initial state and then fork the process for each worker.
This can result in a large performance improvement, especially
memory usage.  Several enterprise Python users (e.g. Instagram,
YouTube) have taken advantage of this.  However, the above
refcount semantics drastically reduce the benefits and
has led to some sub-optimal workarounds.

Also note that "fork" isn't the only operating system mechanism
that uses copy-on-write semantics.  Anything that uses ``mmap``
relies on copy-on-write, including sharing data from shared objects
files between processes.


Rationale
=========

The proposed solution is obvious enough that both of this proposal's
authors came to the same conclusion (and implementation, more or less)
independently.  The Pyston project `uses a similar approach <pyston_>`_.
Other designs were also considered.  Several possibilities have also
been discussed on python-dev in past years.

Alternatives include:

* use a high bit to mark "immortal" but do not change ``Py_INCREF()``
* add an explicit flag to objects
* implement via the type (``tp_dealloc()`` is a no-op)
* track via the object's type object
* track with a separate table

Each of the above makes objects immortal, but none of them address
the performance penalties from refcount modification described above.

In the case of per-interpreter GIL, the only realistic alternative
is to move all global objects into ``PyInterpreterState`` and add
one or more lookup functions to access them.  Then we'd have to
add some hacks to the C-API to preserve compatibility for the
may objects exposed there.  The story is much, much simpler
with immortal objects

Impact
======

Benefits
--------

Most notably, the cases described in the two examples above stand
to benefit greatly from immortal objects.  Projects using pre-fork
can drop their workarounds.  For the per-interpreter GIL project,
immortal objects greatly simplifies the solution for existing static
types, as well as objects exposed by the public C-API.

In general, a strong immutability guarantee for objects enables Python
applications to scale like never before.  This is because they can
then leverage multi-core parallelism without a tradeoff in memory
usage.  This is reflected in most of the above cases.


Performance
-----------

A naive implementation shows `a 4% slowdown`_.
Several promising mitigation strategies will be pursued in the effort
to bring it closer to performance-neutral.

On the positive side, immortal objects save a significant amount of
memory when used with a pre-fork model.  Also, immortal objects provide
opportunities for specialization in the eval loop that would improve
performance.

Backward Compatibility
-----------------------

This proposal is completely compatible.  It is internal-only so no API
is changing.

The approach is also compatible with extensions compiled to the stable
ABI.  Unfortunately, they will modify the refcount and invalidate all
the performance benefits of immortal objects.  However, the high bit
of the refcount will still match ``_Py_IMMORTAL_REFCNT`` so we can
still identify such objects as immortal.

No user-facing behavior changes, with the following exceptions:

* code that inspects the refcount (e.g. ``sys.getrefcount()``
  or directly via ``ob_refcnt``) will see a really, really large
  value
* ``Py_SET_REFCNT()`` will be a no-op for immortal objects

Neither should cause a problem.

Alternate Python Implementations
--------------------------------

This proposal is CPython-specific.

Security Implications
---------------------

This feature has no known impact on security.

Maintainability
---------------

This is not a complex feature so it should not cause much mental
overhead for maintainers.  The basic implementation doesn't touch
much code so it should have much impact on maintainability.  There
may be some extra complexity due to performance penalty mitigation.
However, that should be limited to where we immortalize all
objects post-init and that code will be in one place.

Non-Obvious Consequences
------------------------

* immortal objects that hold references to other objects
  ("containers") effectively immortalize each contained item
* the same is true for objects held internally by other objects
  (e.g. ``PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses``)
* an immortal object's type is effectively immortal
* though extremely unlikely (and technically hard), any object could
  be incref'ed enough to reach ``_Py_IMMORTAL_REFCNT`` and then
  be treated as immortal


Specification
=============

The approach involves these fundamental changes:

* add ``_Py_IMMORTAL_REFCNT`` (the magic value) to the internal C-API
* update ``Py_INCREF()`` and ``Py_DECREF()`` to no-op for objects with
  the magic refcount (or its most significant bit)
* do the same for any other API that modifies the refcount
* stop modifying ``PyGC_Head`` for immortal GC objects ("containers")
* ensure that all immortal objects are cleaned up during
  runtime finalization

Then setting any object's refcount to ``_Py_IMMORTAL_REFCNT``
makes it immortal.

To be clear, we will likely use the most-significant bit of
``_Py_IMMORTAL_REFCNT`` to tell if an object is immortal, rather
than comparing with ``_Py_IMMORTAL_REFCNT`` directly.

(There are other minor, internal changes which are not described here.)

This is not meant to be a public feature but rather an internal one.
So the proposal does *not* including adding any new public C-API,
nor any Python API.  However, this does not prevent us from
adding (publicly accessible) private API to do things
like immortalize an object or tell if one
is immortal.

Affected API
------------

API that will now ignore immortal objects:

* (public) ``Py_INCREF()``
* (public) ``Py_DECREF()``
* (public) ``Py_SET_REFCNT()``
* (private) ``_Py_NewReference()``

API that exposes refcounts (unchanged but may now return large values):

* (public) ``Py_REFCNT()``
* (public) ``sys.getrefcount()``

(Note that ``_Py_RefTotal`` and ``sys.gettotalrefcount()``
will not be affected.)

Immortal Global Objects
-----------------------

The following objects will be made immortal:

* singletons (``None``, ``True``, ``False``, ``Ellipsis``, ``NotImplemented``)
* all static types (e.g. ``PyLong_Type``, ``PyExc_Exception``)
* all static objects in ``_PyRuntimeState.global_objects`` (e.g. identifiers,
  small ints)

There will likely be others we have not enumerated here.

Object Cleanup
--------------

In order to clean up all immortal objects during runtime finalization,
we must keep track of them.

For GC objects ("containers") we'll leverage the GC's permanent
generation by pushing all immortalized containers there.  During
runtime shutdown, the strategy will be to first let the runtime try
to do its best effort of deallocating these instances normally.  Most
of the module deallocation will now be handled by
``pylifecycle.c:finalize_modules()`` which cleans up the remaining
modules as best as we can.  It will change which modules are available
during __del__ but that's already defined as undefined behavior by the
docs.  Optionally, we could do some topological disorder to guarantee
that user modules will be deallocated first before the stdlib modules.
Finally, anything leftover (if any) can be found through the permanent
generation gc list which we can clear after finalize_modules().

For non-container objects, the tracking approach will vary on a
case-by-case basis.  In nearly every case, each such object is directly
accessible on the runtime state, e.g. in a ``_PyRuntimeState`` or
``PyInterpreterState`` field.  We may need to add a tracking mechanism
to the runtime state for a small number of objects.

Possible Changes
----------------

* mark every interned string as immortal
* mark the "interned" dict as immortal if shared else share all interned strings
* (Larry,MvL) mark all constants unmarshalled for a module as immortal
* (Larry,MvL) allocate (immutable) immortal objects in their own memory page(s)

Documentation
-------------

The feature itself is internal and will not be added to the documentation.

We *may* add a note about immortal objects to the following,
to help reduce any surprise users may have with the change:

* ``Py_SET_REFCNT()`` (a no-op for immortal objects)
* ``Py_REFCNT()`` (value may be surprisingly large)
* ``sys.getrefcount()`` (value may be surprisingly large)

Other API that might benefit from such notes are currently undocumented.

We wouldn't add a note anywhere else (including for ``Py_INCREF()`` and
``Py_DECREF()``) since the feature is otherwise transparent to users.


Rejected Ideas
==============

Equate Immortal with Immutable
------------------------------

Making a mutable object immortal isn't particularly helpful.
The exception is if you can ensure the object isn't actually
modified again.  Since we aren't enforcing any immutability
for immortal objects it didn't make sense to emphasis
that relationship.

Discussions

This was discussed in December 2021 on python-dev:

* https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/thread/7O3FUA52QGTVDC6MDAV5WXKNFEDRK5D6/#TBTHSOI2XRWRO6WQOLUW3X7S5DUXFAOV

Runtime Object State
--------------------

Here is the internal state that the CPython runtime keeps
for each Python object:

* `PyObject.ob_refcnt`_: the object's `refcount <refcounting_>`_
* `_PyGC_Head`_: (optional) the object's node in a list of `"GC" objects <refcounting_>`_
* `_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA`_: (optional) the object's node in the list of heap objects

``ob_refcnt`` is part of the memory allocated for every object.
However, ``_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA`` is allocated only if CPython was built
with ``Py_TRACE_REFS`` defined.  ``PyGC_Head`` is allocated only if the
object's type has ``Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC`` set.  Typically this is only
container types (e.g. ``list``).  Also note that ``PyObject.ob_refcnt``
and ``_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA`` are part of ``PyObject_HEAD``.

.. _refcounting:

Reference Counting, with Cyclic Garbage Collection
--------------------------------------------------

Garbage collection is a memory management feature of some programming
languages.  It means objects are cleaned up (e.g. memory freed)
once they are no longer used.

Refcounting is one approach to garbage collection.  The language runtime
tracks how many references are held to an object.  When code takes
ownership of a reference to an object or releases it, the runtime
is notified and it increments or decrements the refcount accordingly.
When the refcount reaches 0, the runtime cleans up the object.

With CPython, code must explicitly take or release references using
the C-API's ``Py_INCREF()`` and ``Py_DECREF()``.  These macros happen
to directly modify the object's refcount (unfortunately, since that
causes ABI compatibility issues if we want to change our garbage
collection scheme).  Also, when an object is cleaned up in CPython,
it also releases any references (and resources) it owns
(before it's memory is freed).

Sometimes objects may be involved in reference cycles, e.g. where
object A holds a reference to object B and object B holds a reference
to object A.  Consequently, neither object would ever be cleaned up
even if no other references were held (i.e. a memory leak).  The
most common objects involved in cycles are containers.

CPython has dedicated machinery to deal with reference cycles, which
we call the "cyclic garbage collector", or often just
"garbage collector" or "GC".  Don't let the name confuse you.
It only deals with breaking reference cycles.

and cyclic garbage collection:
